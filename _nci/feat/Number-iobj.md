## Number[iobj]

In Nahuatl, the subject, object, and (for ditransitive verbs) indirect object 
can all have corresponding number and person agreement morphology on the verb.

* `Number[iobj]` is the number of the indirect object for bitransitive verbs.

For Verbs, we always use the layered Number features. For Nouns and Adjectives, which can be in the Singular or Plural, we use the Number feature.


### <a name="Sing">`Sing`</a>: singular indirect object

Examples: 
 
* [nci] 

### <a name="Plur">`Plur`</a>: plural object

Examples: 

* [nci]
