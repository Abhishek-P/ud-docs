Voice is a feature of verbs that helps map the traditional syntactic functions,
such as subject and object, to semantic roles, such as agent and patient.

* In Classical Armenian, the voice category is expressed by the endings or a derivational causaitve suffix. Only part of inflectional forms are marked for voice; some forms are underspecified for voice (labile), for example, the first plural form of the aorist indicative _լուաք_/_luakʽ_ “we heard / we were heard”. 
* The morphological causative is a derivational category. Derived causatives can be marked by the inflectional voice as `Act` or `Pass`, which makes the voice a layered feature in Classical Armenian. The causative layer is identified as [Voice[caus]]() and invariably takes the value `Cau`.

### <a name="Act">`Act`</a>: active voice

The subject of the verb is typically the doer of the action (agent) that affects the object (patient)
by the action.

#### Examples

* Պատրաստ արարէք զճանապարհ Տեառն: / _Patrast <b>ararēkʻ</b>_ (2pl. aor.ind.act) _zčanaparh Teaṙn._ “<b>Prepare</b> ye the way of the Lord” (Luke 3:4).

### <a name="Pass">`Pass`</a>: non-active voice (passive, middle, reflexive, etc.)

In Classical Armenian, the tag `Pass` covers a wide range of intransitive and valency-decreasing meanings such as passive, middle, and reflexive. The subject of the verb typically either spontaneousely undergoes an change of state, or is affected by the action carried out by an agent facutlatively expressed by an oblique complement.

#### Examples

* _Եւ _արդարացաւ_ իմաստութիւն յորդւոց իւրոց:_ / _Ew <b>ardaracʻaw</b>_ (3sg. aor.ind.pass) _imastowtʻiwn yordwocʻ iwrocʻ_  “And yet wisdom <b>is vindicated</b> by all her children” (Luke 7:35).
