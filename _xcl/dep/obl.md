The `obl` relation is used for a nominal (noun, pronoun, noun phrase) functioning as a non-core (oblique) argument or adjunct. This means that it functionally corresponds to an adverbial attaching to a verb, adjective or other adverb. In Classical Armenian, the `obl` relation is specified either by bare case forms or by case forms in conjunction with adposition(s). Specialized relation [obl:agent](xcl-dep/obl-agent) is used for an agent of the passive construction, and [obl:arg](xcl-dep/obl-arg) is used for either an agent expressed by the genitive case in the periphrastic perfect tenses or a recipient-like participant expressed by the prepositional phrase ց=/_cՙ_= plus the accusative.
