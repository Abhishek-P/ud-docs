The `fixed` relation is used for grammaticized multiword expressions, which behave like function words. 
Fixed MWEs are annotated in a flat structure, where all subsequent words in the expression are attached to the first one using the `fixed` label. 
The assumption is that these expressions do not have any internal syntactic structure.

In UD_Classical_Armenian-CAVaL, `fixed` is used for multiword adpositions and conjunctions. 
In Classical Armenian, the head of multiword adposition is always an adposition, whereas the following element can be another adposition, an adverb, or a noun.
