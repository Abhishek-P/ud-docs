An open clausal complement (`xcomp`) of a verb or an adjective is (i) a core argument of the verb, (ii) which is without its own subject and (iii) for which the reference of the subject is necessarily determined by an argument external to the xcomp. The third requirement is often referred to as obligatory control. An `xcomp` can also be described as a predicative complement. The subject of the `xcomp` is normally, but not always, controlled by the object of the next higher clause, if there is one, or else by the subject of the next higher clause.

Ոչ կարէ քաղաք թաքչել որ ի վերայ լերին կայցէ : \n A city that is set on an hill cannot be hid .
xcomp(կարէ, թաքչել)
xcomp(cannot, hid)

Contrast `xcomp` with other complement clauses where there is an overt subject or no obligatory control, which use `ccomp` (xcl-dep/ccomp).

Note that `xcomp` is used for core arguments of predicates so it will not be used for non-core instances of secondary predication with the relation `advcl` (xcl-dep/advcl).
