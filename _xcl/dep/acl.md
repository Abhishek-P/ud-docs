`acl` stands for finite and non-finite clauses that modify a nominal.  The `acl` relation contrasts with the [advcl]() relation, which is used for adverbial clauses that modify a predicate. The head of the `acl` relation is the noun that is modified, and the dependent is the head of the clause that modifies the noun.
