### Definition

An interjection is a word that is used most often as an exclamation. It typically expresses an emotional reaction, is not syntactically related to other accompanying expressions, and may include a combination of sounds not otherwise found in the language. 

In Classical Armenian, interjections can contain _infixed punctuation_ (exclamation and emphasis marks placed on the accented syllable).

Classical Armenian has demonstrative interjection _ահա_ “behold!”, which takes the feature `PronType=Dem`. This interjection has emphatic forms (_աւասիկ_, _աւադիկ_, _աւանիկ_ and _ահաւասիկ_, _ահաւադիկ_, _ահաւանիկ_), which additionally express the three-way deictic contrast (tagged as `Deixis=Prox, Med, Remt`). A special case of interjections are feedback particles such as _այո՛_, _ո՛չ_, etc.

### Examples

- Emotive interjections: _ով_ “oh!”, _վահ_ “alas!”
- Demonstrative interjections: _ահա_ (and its emphatic variant _ահաւադիկ_) “behold!”
- Feedback interjections: _այո_ “yes!”, _ոչ_ “no!”
