### Definition

A verb is a member of the syntactic class of words that typically signal events and actions, can constitute a minimal predicate in a clause, and govern the number and types of other constituents which
may occur in the clause.

Note that the `VERB` tag covers main verbs _(content verbs)_, but it does not cover _auxiliary verbs_ and _copulas,_ for which there is the [AUX]() tag.

Classical Armenian verbs can have the following forms:

- Finite verb `Fin` (forms inflected for person)
- Infinitive `Inf` (uninflected form coding the secondary predication)
- Converb `Conv` (uninflected form with an optative meaning)
- Participle `Part` (inflected past participle)
- Verbal noun `Vnoun` (inflected deverbal noun; the nominative counsides with the infinitive)

Although the verbal noun functions as a nominal and the past participle can be used adjectivally, they are consistently tagged [VERB]() or [AUX]().

Finite verbs can be marked for: [Person](), [Number](), [Aspect](), [Mood](), [Polarity](), [Tense](), and [Voice](). Participles and verbal nouns have [Case]().

### Examples

- Finate verb: _գրեմ_/_grem_ “I write”
- Infinitive: _գրել_/_grel_ “to write”
- Converb: _գալոց_/_galocʽ_ “for coming”
- Participle: _մտեալ_/_mteal_ “entering”
- Verbal noun: _գրել_/_grel_ “writing”
