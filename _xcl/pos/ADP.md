### Definition

Classical Armenian has prepositions, postpositions, and circumpositions. Prepositions _զ_/_z_, _ց_/_cʻ_ and _յ_/_y_ (an antevocalic form of _ի_/_i_) are spelled together with the following word but are treated as separate tokens. Some adpositions are fossilized case forms of nouns, cf. պատճառաւ “because” (used with a noun in the genitive), which coincides with the instrumental case of պատճառ “cause”.

The word _զ_/_z_ is grammaticalized as a marker of referential prominence (definiteness) when added to the direct object in the accusative case. Although this use is functionally close to a definite article and could be classified as a determiner in UD, it is annotated as an adposition for the sake of consistency with expressions where _z=_ is combined with other cases.

When a noun phrase contains a modifier, prepositions can be repeated before each of the constituents of the noun phrase (see Meyer 2023). This occurs more often when the modifier follows the noun, in which case it is also typically inflected in case and number (see [ADJ]()).

Complex prepositions form multiword expressions. The status of component words as multiword expressions is accounted for in the syntactic annotation ([fixed]()). All component words are tagged as `ADP` (even in the case of foscilized prepositional phrases) because complex prepositions can be occasionally disrupted by a head noun, in which case they turn into a circumposition and their parts are linked to the head by the syntactic relation [case](), cf. _<b>յ</b>որոյ <b>վերայ</b> քաղաքն նոցա շինեալ էր_ / _<b>y</b>oroy <b>veray</b> kʻałakʻn nocʻa šineal ēr_ “on which their city had been built” (Lk. 4:29) next to a complex preposition _ի վերայ_/_i veray_ “upon”, or _վայ այնմիկ է <b>յ</b>ոյր <b>ձեռն</b> գայցէ_ / _vay aynmik ē <b>y</b>oyr <b>jeṙn</b> gaycʻē_ “woe to one through whom they come” (Lk. 17:1) next to _ի ձեռն_/_i jeṙn_ “by means of” (literally “to hand”).

Classical Armenian postpositions include demonstrative local adverbs (such as _անտի_/_anti_), which reinforce the meaning of prepositional construction. When used in this function, local adverbs are tagged as `ADP`, take the syntactic relation [case](), and become constituents of circumpositions, cf. _էջ <b>ի</b> լեռնէ <b>անտի</b> / _ēǰ <b>i</b> leṙnē <b>anti</b>_ “he came down from the mountain” (Mt. 8:1). The demonstrative postpositions express a three-way [Deixis]() distinction.

### Examples

- Prepositions: _առ_/_aṙ_ “to”, _առ ի_/_aṙ i_ “in order to”
- Complex prepositions: 
- Postpostions: _հանդերձ_/_handerj_ “together with”
- Circumpositions։ _<b>ի</b> լեռնէ <b>անտի</b>_ / _<b>i</b> leṙnē <b>anti</b>_, _<b>յ=</b>որոյ <b>վերայ</b>_ / _<b>y=</b>oroy <b>veray</b>_
