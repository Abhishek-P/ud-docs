### Definition

Determiners are words that modify [nouns](NOUN) or noun phrases and express the reference of the noun phrase in context. That is, a determiner may indicate whether the noun is referring to a definite or indefinite element of a class, to a closer or more distant element, to an element belonging to a specified person or thing, to a particular number or quantity, etc. Under this definition, determiners include _articles_ and _pronominal adjectives_. 
In Classical Armenian, the tag [DET]() is used for: demonstrative/possessive particles, determinate direct object proclitic _զ_=/_z_= (tradictionally called _nota accusativi_), pronominal adjectives, including indefinite pronominal adjectives, quantifiers.
Adjectival pronouns and pronominal quantifiers are traditionally included into pronouns. However, the tag [PRON]() is reserved for pronouns occurring as the head of a noun phrase in UD. Pronominal adjectives of animate and inanimate indefinite pronouns inflect for [Animacy]() and [Definite]() morphological features.

When the proclitic _զ_=/_z_= is used with other cases than the accusative, it does not have a clear determiner function and is tagged [ADP]() with the [case]() relation.

### Examples

- demonstrative/possessive particles: =ս/=s, =դ/=d, =ն/=n
- determinate direct object proclitic: _զ_=/_z_=
- pronominal adjectives, including indefinite pronominal adjectives: _իմ_/_im_ “my”, _ոմն_/_omn_ “certain”
- quantifiers: _մի_/_mi_ “certain”, _ամենայն_/_amenayn_ “every”, _բազում_/_bazowm_ “many”
