Boolean feature. Is this a foreign word? Not a loan word and not a foreign name but a genuinely foreign word appearing inside native
text, e.g. inside direct speech, titles of books etc. This feature would apply either to the [X](_ka/pos/X) part of speech (unanalyzable token), or to other parts of speech if we know and are willing to annotate the class to which the word belongs in its original language.


### <a name="Yes">`Yes`</a>: it is foreign

#### Example 

* _პასუხად ღებულობდნენ: <b>"Αληθώς Ανέστη!"</b> („ალითოს ანესტი!")._ 'They received an answer: "Αληθώς Ανέστη!".
