The `Voice` feature applies to [VERB](_ka/pos/VERB).

### <a name="Act">`Act`</a>: active and autoactive voices

The subject of the verb is the doer of the action (agent), the object is affected by the action (patient). This label is also used for the autoactive voice, when the subject of the verb is the agent and the patient of the action.

#### Examples

* _ბავშვი <b>ხატავს</b> სურათს._ 'A child draws a picture.'

### <a name="Mid">`Mid`</a>: inactive and mediopassive voices

The subject of the verb is medially affected by the action.

#### Examples

* _ქალს <b>ჰქვია</b> თამარი._ 'The woman's name is Tamar.'

### <a name="Pass">`Pass`</a>: passive voice

The subject of the verb is affected by the action (patient). The doer (agent) is either unexpressed or it appears as an oblique dependent or an object of the verb. 

#### Examples

* _ბავშვი <b>დაიბადა</b> ჯანმრთელი._ 'The child has been born healthy.'
