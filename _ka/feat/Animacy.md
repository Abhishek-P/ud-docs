Animacy is a lexical feature of nouns. In Georgian the category of animacy does not have special morphological markers, but it
affects verbal number agreement at the syntactic level, in that plural number agreement occurs obligatorily in the case of animate nominals bearing the -ებ-, -ნ and -თ- plural markers and very rarely in the case of inanimate NPs bearing the -ებ- marker; mainly, human is animate, nonhuman - inanimate. The principal rule followed by verbs with regard to number agreement is that an animate agent is prevails over an inanimate.

The `Animacy` feature applies to [NOUN](_ka/pos/NOUN) and [PROPN](_ka/pos/PROPN).
