### Definition

A verb is a member of the syntactic class of words typically denoting events and actions, constituting a minimal predicate in a clause, governing the number and types of dependents which may occur in the clause. In Georgain verbs are associated with grammatical properties such as: tense, aspect, mood, voice, person aggreement and number, which can either be expressed inflectionally or using auxiliary verbs (rarely). Georgian verb has not infinitive form. There are two types of verbal forms: participles (VerbForm=Part) and masdars (VerbForm=Vnoun), see [VerbForm](_ka/feat/VerbForm). 

There are two types of verb in Georgian: main verbs and auxiliary verbs. Lexical verbs, which have their own lexical meaning, indicate semantic relationship between participangs in the clause, while auxiliary verbs, which contribute only grammatical meaning, can be attached to main verbs or nouns in the form of a clitic or appear independently depending on the type of clause. The `VERB` tag covers main verbs (content verbs) but it does not cover auxiliary verbs for which the `AUX`, see [AUX](_ka/pos/AUX_) tag is used. In case an auxiliary is attached to the main verb, it is considered as verbal type, see [VerbType](_ka/feat/VerbType).
