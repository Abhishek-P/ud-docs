### Definition

Adjectives are words that typically modify nouns and specify their properties or attributes. Used attributively, consonant-final adjectives occur in structurally unmarked forms in the dative and adverbial cases and in partially marked forms in the genitive
and instrumental cases, while vowel-final adjectives occur in their structurally unmarked forms in all cases. Used predicatively, both consonant-final and vowelfinal adjectives follow rules of paradigm formation. While there are no restrictions on the use of adjectives preceding or following the noun, prepositive placement is more frequent in Modern Georgian.

Adjectives in Georgian normally agree in number and case with the noun they modify (both preceding or following nouns), e.g. _მაღალი სახლის_ 'of the high house' (singular genetive), _სახლსა მაღალსა_ 'to the high house' (singular dative).
