### Definition

Nouns are a part of speech typically denoting a person, place, thing, animal or idea. In Georgian nouns are subdivided into proper and
common nouns, both of which can be inflected for case and number. While the distribution into proper and common nouns is purely semantic, in contrast to common nouns, proper nouns form plural forms rarely. 

The `NOUN` tag is intended for common nouns only. See [PROPN](_ka/pos/PROPN) for proper nouns.
