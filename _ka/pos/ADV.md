### Definition

Adverbs are words that typically modify [verbs](_ka/pos/VERB) for such categories as time, place, direction or manner. In Georgian, they may also modify [adjectives](_ka/pos/ADJ) (as in _<b>ძალიან</b> ლამაზი_ "very beautiful"), other adverbs (as in _<b>ძალიან</b> კარგად_ "very well"). There are eight different types of adverbs in Georgian: local (AdvType=Loc), temporal (AdvType=Tim), modifier (AdvType=Man), quantitative (AdvType=Deg), causal (AdvType=Cau), interrogative (AdvType=Int) and relative (AdvType=Rel). Generally, adverbs can be considered a closed class of items which can be expanded with two slots, namely a slot for postpositions and for indirect speech markers, but in Georgian, adverbs often have particles added to them, indicating their type, see [PartType](_ka/feat/PartType).
