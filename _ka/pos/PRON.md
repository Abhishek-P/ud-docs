### Definition

Pronouns are words that substitute for [nouns](NOUN) or noun phrases, whose meaning is recoverable from the linguistic or extralinguistic
context. Pronouns in Georgian are of the following types: personal (PronType=Prs), demonstrative (PronType=Dem), possessive (Poss=Yes), determinal/reflexive (PronType=Tot), indefinite (PronType=Ind), interrogative (PronType=Int), relative (PronType=Rel), reciprocal (PronType=Rcp) and negative (PronType=Neg). In comparison with other nominals, the inflectional paradigms of the aforementioned
pronoun types are very irregular; some of the them follow the rules of the nominal declensions and exhibit different forms based on agreement between person, case and number, while others do not.
