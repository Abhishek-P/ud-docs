### Definition

The tag `X` is used for words that for some reason cannot be assigned a real part-of-speech category. In Georgian it is used for foreign words where it is not possible to analyze their grammatical structure and where the dependency relation _foreign_ is
typically used in the syntactic analysis. 

This usage does not extend to ordinary loan words where it is assigned a normal part-of-speech. 


### Examples

* <b>Αληθώς Ανέστη</b>
* <b>res nullius</b>
* <b>pro capite</b>
