An open clausal complement (<code>xcomp</code>) of a verb, or an adjective, is a predicative or clausal complement without its own subject. The reference of the subject is necessarily determined by an argument external to the <code>xcomp</code> (usually by the object, if there is one, or else by the subject of the next higher clause). This reference is often referred to as **obligatory control**, that is there should be no available interpretation where the subject of the lower clause may be distinct from the specified role of the upper clause (in case the subject may or must be distinct from the subject of the higher clause, <code>ccomp</code> should be used).
