`list` is used for list items. <code>list</code> covers bullet points, numbered lists and similar cases. However it does **not** cover list items constructed with coordinating conjunctions and punctuation: those cases are covered by the dependency relations [cc](_ka/dep/cc) and [conj](_ka/dep/conj).
