A passive nominal subject is a noun phrase which is the syntactic subject of a passive clause (or more generally, any voice where the proto-agent argument does not become the subject of the clause). E.g.

~~~ sdparse
ჩანთა დამალულ იქნა ბავშვის მიერ. /n 'The bag was hidden by the child.'
nsubj:pass(იქნა, ჩანთა)
~~~
