The <code>fixed</code> relation is one of the three relations for multiword expressions (MWEs) (the other two being [flat](_ka/dep/flat) and [compound](_ka/dep/compound)). It is used for certain fixed grammaticized expressions that behave like function words or short adverbials. Any grammatical class can take part in a multiword expression. Fixed MWEs are annotated in a flat structure, where all subsequent words in the expression are attached to the first one.

Some of the <code>fixed</code> idiomatic cases for Georgian are listed in the examples below.
