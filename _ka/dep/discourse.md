This is used for interjections and other discourse particles and elements (which are not clearly linked to the structure of the sentence, except in an expressive way). In Georgian the use of <code>discourse</code> is attested for interjections (verbs or nouns used as interjections) only, but is also generally recommended for emoticons.
