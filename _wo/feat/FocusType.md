Wolof has three focus conjugations of its [auxiliaries](u-pos/AUX): subject focus, verb focus, and complement
focus. The form of the auxiliary varies according to the syntactic function of the focused
constituent: subject, verb, or complement. The latter has a broad meaning and refers in general
to any constituent which is neither subject nor main verb.

### <a name="Subj">`Subj`</a>: subject focus

The auxiliary indicates that the subject of the clause is in focus.

#### Examples

*  _<b>maa</b> lekk jën_ “I ate fish (it's me who ate fish)”
*  _<b>yaa</b> lekk jën_ “you ate fish (it's you who ate fish)”
*  _Faatu <b>moo</b> lekk jën_ “Faatu ate fish (it's Faatu who ate fish)”
*  _<b>noo</b> lekk jën_ “we ate fish (it's us who ate fish)”
*  _<b>yeena</b> lekk jën_ “you ate fish (it's you guys who ate fish)”
*  _<b>ñoo</b> lekk jën_ “they ate fish (it's them who ate fish)”

### <a name="Verb">`Verb`</a>: verb focus

The auxiliary indicates that the main verb of the clause is in focus.

#### Examples

*  _<b>dama</b> lekk jën_ “I ate fish (what I did is eat fish)”
*  _<b>danga</b> lekk jën_ “you ate fish (what you did is eat fish)”
*  _Faatu <b>dafa</b> lekk jën_ “Faatu ate fish (what Faatu did is eat fish)”
*  _<b>danu</b> lekk jën_ “we ate fish (what we did is eat fish)”
*  _<b>dangeen</b> lekk jën_ “you ate fish (what you guys did is eat fish)”
*  _<b>dañu</b> lekk jën_ “they ate fish (what they did is eat fish)”

### <a name="Compl">`Compl`</a>: complement focus

The auxiliary indicates that the constituent in focus is neither the subject nor the main verb.

#### Examples

*  _jën <b>laa</b> lekk_ “I ate fish (it's fish what I ate)”
*  _jën <b>nga</b> lekk_ “you ate fish (it's fish what you ate)”
*  _jën <b>la</b> Faatu lekk_ “Faatu ate fish (it's fish what Faatu ate)”
*  _jën <b>lanu</b> lekk_ “we ate fish (it's fish what we ate)”
*  _jën <b>ngeen</b> lekk_ “you ate fish (it's fish what you guys ate)”
*  _jën <b>lañu</b> lekk_ “they ate fish (it's fish what they ate)”
