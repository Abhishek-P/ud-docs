The `Variant` feature helps distinguish “short” (nominal) forms of adjectives from the “long”
(pronominal) ones. Like in other Slavic UD treebanks, only `Variant=Short` is overtly marked
while the long forms lack the `Variant` feature. Besides adjectives ([ADJ]()), the feature also
applies to participles ([VERB]()).

### <a name="Short">`Short`</a>: short form of adjectives or participles

The short form is called _nominal form of adjective_, as opposed to the long form, which is
_pronominal_ because it originated as a combination of a nominal form and a personal pronoun.

#### Examples

* _<b>чистъ</b>_ “clear, clean”, long equivalent: _чистꙑ_
