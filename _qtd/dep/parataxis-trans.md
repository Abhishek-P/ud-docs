This is a subtype of  [parataxis](). 
In code-switching it is common to utter a word, phrase or clause in one language and repeating it as a translation in the other language. 
In the following example German 'gehe auch' (I go too) is repeated again as Turkish 'de gidiyorum'. The relation `parataxis:trans` captures
such phenomena. The relation connects the head of the second constituent to the head of the first constituent as a dependent.
Note that there is a separate subtype for noun phrases, namely `appos:trans`, for the same phenomenon.
