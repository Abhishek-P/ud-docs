Case helps specify the role of the noun phrase in the sentence. Connections of nouns with nouns or other words in subordinate situations are called Cases.  Cases determine the function of a noun in a sentence. For example, a noun in the nominative can be in most cases subject, noun-verb, and when it comes in the place of an adjective, it can be a determiner.

There are 6 Cases in the Uzbek language: `Nom`, `Acc`, `Gen`, `Dat`, `Loc`, `Abl`.

### <a name="Nom">`Nom`</a>: nominative / direct

The base form of the noun, typically used as citation form (lemma).

#### Examples

* _<b>Kitob(-)</b> stol ustida_ “The book is on the table”
* _<b>Kitob(ni)</b> o‘qidi_ “He/She reads book”

### <a name="Acc">`Acc`</a>: accusative

Typically, the accusative case in Uzbek marks the definite direct object in a sentence. Indefinite direct objects do not receive the accusative suffix, but stay in bare form
(`Nom`).

In Uzbek `Acc` is expressed by suffix _-ni, -in, -n, -i(in literature)_.

#### Examples

* _Kitob<b>(ni)</b> o‘qiyapti_ “He/She is reading a book”
* _Kitob<b>ni</b> o‘qiyapti_ “He/She is reading the book”

### <a name="Dat">`Dat`</a>: dative

Dative case is typically used to indicate movement into/towards/to a place or time. The oblique arguments of some verbs and complements (noun phrases) of some postpositions also required to be in dative case. That is, a suffix that connects nouns with verbs in subordinate situations. 

Sometimes (rarely) the suffix is hidden in the base form.

In the Uzbek language, the case dative (Dat) is expressed by the suffixes _-ga, -ka, -qa, -a, -ga, -na_. _-ka_ is added to nouns ending in _-k_, and _-qa_ to nouns ending in _-q_.

#### Examples

* _Daftar<b>(ga)</b> yozdi_  “He/She wrote to the notebook” - _(when a person and predmet are added to the complement)_
* _Maktab<b>(ga)</b> bordi_  “He/She went to the school” - _(The locative case when added to locative nouns)_
* _Bilmaganiga o‘kindi_ “he/she regretted of not knowing” - _(Sabab holi, sabab bois ma’nolarini anglatgan hollarda)_
* Toshkent<b>~~(ga)~~</b> bordi “She/He went to Tashkent” - (Base hidden form) 

### <a name="Gen">`Gen`</a>: genitive

Prototypical meaning of genitive is that the noun phrase somehow belongs to its governor; it would often be translated by the English preposition _of_. Complements of some postpositions are also required to be in genitive case.
The genitive morpheme also marks the subject of the subordinate clauses. The conjunction connecting the noun with the subordinate noun is sometimes used without a sign. Usually in Uzbek, the indicative case is used when it represents a specific object. It is used without a sign when talking about an indefinite subject.

In the Uzbek language, the genitive(`Gen`) case has the forms _-ning_, _-in_, _-n_, _-m_, _-im_ (in fiction).

#### Examples

* _Kitob<b>(ning)</b> beti_  “The page of a book”
* _Kitobning beti_  “The page of the book”
* _Otin boshin burdi_ “He turned the head of his horse”
* _O‘zbekiston - vatanim manim_ “Uzbekistan is my motherland” 

### <a name="Loc">`Loc`</a>: locative

The locative case often expresses location in space or time, which gave it its name. The oblique arguments of some verbs and complements (noun phrases) also required to be in locative case.

In Uzbek, `Loc` is expressed by suffix _-da_.

#### Examples
* _Daftarda bor_  “It exists on the notebook” - (Shaxs va narsa buyum otlariga qo'shilganda to‘ldiruvchi)
* _Maktabda o‘qidi_   “He/She studied at the school” - (O‘rin bildiruvchi otlarga qo‘shilganda o‘rin holi)
* _Qishda keldi_ “He/She came in the winter” - (Payt holi)
* _Dehqon bo‘lsang kuz hayda_ “if you are peasant, plow in an autumn” - (Belgisiz qo‘llanilishi) 

### <a name="Abl">`Abl`</a>: ablative

Prototypical meaning: direction from some point. The oblique arguments of some verbs and complements (noun phrases) of some postpositions also required to be in ablative case. A suffix/affix connecting nouns with verbs in subordinate siutations.
Sometimes (rarely) the suffix is hidden in the base form.
In Uzbek, Ablative case is expressed by the suffix <b>-dan</b>.

#### Examples
* Kitob<b>dan</b> o’qidim  “I read from the book” - (Shaxs va narsa buyum otlariga qo'shilganda to‘ldiruvchi)
* Maktab<b>dan</b> chiqdi   “He/She went outside the school” - (O‘rin bildiruvchi otlarga qo‘shilganda o‘rin holi)
* Qish<b>dan</b> beri aytaman “I have been saying this since winter” - (Payt holi)
* Bilmagani<b>dan</b> o‘kindi  “he/she regretted of not knowing” - (Sabab holi, sabab bois ma’nolarini anglatgan hollarda)
