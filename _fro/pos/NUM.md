### Definition

A numeral is a word, functioning most typically as a determiner, a pronoun or an adjective, that expresses a number and a relation to the number, such as quantity, sequence, frequency or fraction.

In the Old French treebank, `NUM` concerns cardinal `DET` only.

By contrast, ordinal numerals and cardinal adjectives are always tagged `ADJ`, and cardinal pronouns are tagged `PRON`.
