# UD for Neapolitan <span class="flagspan"><img class="flag" src="../../flags/svg/IT-CAM.svg" /></span>

## Tokenization and Word Segmentation

* Words are delimited by whitespace or apostrophes. The apostrophes indicate elision, i.e. the omission of a sound in a word.
* In Neapolitan, articles undergo elision, e.g.: _unu_ → _'nu_.INDF.M; _de/re_ → _'e_.GEN
* Multiword tokens do occur, namely:
  - in the form of preposition combined with a definite article -> [ADP]()+[DET]().
  - in the form of clitic pronouns, e.g. _rammellĕ_ "give them to me"
  - with partitive clitics, e.g. _vavattennĕ_ "go away.(from here)"

## Morphology

### Tags

* Neapolitan uses all 17 universal tags.
* Auxiliaries are verbal, usually formed from the verbs _essĕ_ "to be" and _avé_ “to have”, which indicates perfective aspect. The tag AUX is mainly used to mark:
  - _essĕ_ "to be", which is also the copula;
  - tense auxiliaries formed, as also in Italian, by _essĕ_ "to be" and _avé_ “to have”;
  - auxiliaries in the progressive form, such _stonghĕ venennĕ_ "I am coming"
 * (De)verbal forms can be tagged in different ways.
 * Participles are usually tagged as [ADJ]().
 * Infinitive forms are always tagged as [NOUN]().

### Features

* Nouns are inflected by [Gender](M or F) and [Number](Sg or Pl).
* Sometimes, the difference is only graphic, as most word-final vowels are reduced (indicated with a breve diacritic).
  - Example: _gruossŏ_ “big”.`Masc`.`Sing` vs. _gruossĕ_ “big”.`Masc`.`Plur`
* Grammatical gender is often marked not by the final vowel, but by the word-internal vowel or diphthong.
  - Example: _gruossŏ_ “big”.`Masc`.`Sing` vs. _grossă_ “big”.`Fem`.`Sing`

* Verbs all end with a reduced vowel. However, the distinction between etymological forms is retained by graphemes with a breve diacritic.
  - Example: _ijĕ magnĕ_ “I eat”; _issŏ magnă_ “he eats”
* Often there is alternation between imperfect and simple past (with perfective meaning), used interchangeably, e.g.:
  - _Venevă ccà e facettĕ..._ "(He/she) came here and was like..." _venevă_.IMP; _facettĕ_.PERF
* Adverbs inflect for degree. However, Neapolitan tends to use the intensifier _cchiù_ "more" in phrases like _cchiù megliŏ_ lit. "more better", where _megliŏ_ "better" is already in the comparative grade.

## Syntax

* Subjects are constituted of noun phrases, which can be also deverbal. They are not marked and usually preceed the verb, except for presentational constructions, e.g.:
  - _Dimmanĕ venĕ Giuvannĕ_ “Tomorrow John is coming”
* Subjects can be omitted, since Neapolitan is a pro-drop language.
* Objects usually follow the main verb, or can be constituted by whole clauses, e.g.:
  - _Cantavă 'na canzonă_ "(He/she) sang/was singing a song"
* Whole clauses can also be subjects of benefactive constructions in dative, e.g.:
  - _Mĕ piacĕ 'e pazzià a ppallonĕ_ "I like to play football"
