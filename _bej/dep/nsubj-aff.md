In addition to a possible independent lexical or pronominal subject, the Beja verb calls for an attached pronominal subject marker.
The dependency type `nsubj:aff` marks additionnal pronominal subjects of a clause.
Subjects are direct dependents of the main predicate of the clause, which is a pronoun for the `aff` subrelation.
