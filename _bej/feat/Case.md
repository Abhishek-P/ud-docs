In Beja, `Case` is an inflectional feature of [adpositions](_bej/pos/ADP), [determiners](_bej/pos/DET), [particles](_bej/pos/PART) and [pronouns](_bej/pos/PRON).

Case helps specify the role of the noun phrase in the sentence. 


### <a name="Abl">`Abl`</a>: ablatif

Prototypical meaning: direction from some point.

#### Examples
- _ajwa / adit whisi gajjarant / <b>hoːj</b> sallamaman ini //_ " "I changed my voice, and I took it from him", he said."


### <a name="Acc">`Acc`</a>: accusative

Typically used when a noun or a personal pronoun is used as a complement for a predicate.

#### Examples
- _uːn uː= tak / doːr han kan -aː <b>=ji</b> ki= i- ki / ti= takat hiːs =heːb =ajt //_ "this man had not even recognized me because he thought I was the woman."


### <a name="Com">`Com`</a>: comitive

The comitative case corresponds to English “together with …”

#### Examples
- _naːn <b>haːj</b> jʔ -aː =t =oːk =t =u ?_ "What has brought you there ?"


### <a name="Dat">`Dat`</a>: dative

Dative marks indirect objects or recipients of verbs. Beja has a dative set of pronouns, but nouns are marked with the directional postposition. 

#### Examples
- _<b>dhaːj</b> jʔ -an =hoːb oː= tak / meːk dh# ## eːja =ajt oː= gaw / tam -ja eːn //_ "When I went to visit him, a man, a donkey, hum, came and ate his tent, they said."


### <a name="Dis">`Dis`</a>: distributive

The distributive case conveys that something happened to every member of a set, one in a time. Or it may express frequency.

#### Examples
- _i- ki sar -oːj <b>=ka</b> / w= hanʤar sallam -an /_ "Anyway, I gave her the dagger"


### <a name="Gen">`Gen`</a>: genitive

In Beja the genitive relation between a head noun and a dependent noun is marked by a suffix on the dependent noun.

#### Examples
- _tak / ʔeːgirim // ʔajaːj tak <b>-i</b> iː- fi =t amsi iraːnaj rh -i / oː= kina /_ "There was an old man of my family and, gosh! I even saw him today."


### <a name="Loc">`Loc`</a>: locative

In Beja, the locative is typically expressed by a enclitic postposition.

#### Examples
- _beːn / i= ʃarg <b>=iːb</b> iː- fi =ajt // i= kaːm =iji_ "I was over there at Sharg"


### <a name="Nom">`Nom`</a>: nominative

Typically used when a noun or a personal pronoun is used as the subject of a clause. It is marked on determiners and pronouns in Beja.

#### Examples
- _tak / kaːm <b>=i</b> / hoː kʷiɖ -ja i- ni //_ "A man said: "My camel disappeared." "
- _<b>uː=</b> tak ɖaːb -iːni kaːm i- bari / "The man has a race camel" 
 
### <a name="Voc">`Voc`</a>: vocative

In Beja the vocative is a suffix on nouns that marks the addressee.

#### Examples
- _maːlk<b>-i jhaː</b>_ Malik!"
