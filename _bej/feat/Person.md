Person is typically feature of personal and possessive
[pronouns](_bej/pos/PRON) / [determiners](_bej/pos/DET), and of [verbs](_bej/pos/VERB). On verbs it is in
fact an agreement feature that marks the person of the verb's subject or object. 

### <a name="1">`1`</a>: first person

In singular, the first person refers just to the speaker / author. In
plural, it must include the speaker and one or more additional
persons. 

#### Examples

### <a name="2">`2`</a>: second person

In singular, the second person refers to the addressee of the
utterance / text. In plural, it may mean several addressees and
optionally some third persons too.

#### Examples

### <a name="3">`3`</a>: third person

The third person refers to one or more persons that are neither
speakers nor addressees.
