This feature indicates, for the head of a [fixed expression](https://universaldependencies.org/en/dep/fixed.html), 
the effective UPOS of the full expression when it differs from the UPOS of the word itself.
Occasionally, `ExtPos` is used even if `ExtPos` = `upos`.

`ExtPos` is used in the [SUD](https://surfacesyntacticud.github.io/) framework.
It is kept in FEATS in the UD conversion.
