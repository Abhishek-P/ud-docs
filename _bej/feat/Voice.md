Voice is typically a feature of [verbs](u-pos/VERB) and verbal affixes/clitics categorized as [auxiliaries](bej-pos/AUX).

### <a name="Mid">`Mid`</a>: middle voice

Between active and passive.
The subject is both doer and undergoer in a sense:
he is acting upon himself.

#### Examples
- _a- <b>gar</b> jʔ -an =t i= gaw =i /_ "I went back, in my house."


### <a name="Rcp">`Rcp`</a>: reciprocal voice

In a plural subject, all members are doers and undergoers,
acting upon each other.

#### Examples
- _uː= dhaj kass =aː i- ktiːn -n =i kaːm =u =it / ʔajaːj tak =uːn hoːj <b>am-</b> mar~ri -ja eːn eː= nda /_ "Because it was a camel that everybody knew; one of our relatives (told) to these men"

### <a name="Pass">`Pass`</a>: passive or patient-focus voice

The subject of the verb is affected by the action (patient). The doer
(agent) is not unexpressed in Beja.

#### Examples
- _i= magʷal hoːg -aː =b =u =it ki= i- <b>t-</b> kattaːm /_


### <a name="Cau">`Cau`</a>: causative voice

Causative expresses a subject that is the cause of the action done by a distinct agent and is described by the verbal affix categorized as [auxiliaries](bej-pos/AUX).

#### Examples
- _uː= tak ʔaraːw =i aka -jeː hoːj giːg <b>-is<b> -ta =ja_ "you made the man who is my friend leave for good!"
