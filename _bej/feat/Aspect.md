In Beja, aspect is an inflexionnal feature of [verbs](../pos/VERB), [auxiliaries](../pos/AUX) and verbal affixes/clitics (see [SCONJ](../pos/SCONJ), [PART](../pos/PART)) that specifies the duration and completion of processes in time.


### <a name="Aor">`Aor`</a>: aorist

The aorist expresses semantic values of habituality, repetition, general truth and anteriority. It can also be also used in backgrounded contexts, and for the expression of a wish. It is not time referenced.

#### Example

-  _hoː =b hoːsoː ʃʔag -aː =b =u uː= tak // ʔasal -aː =b iː- <b>kti</b> =jeːb /_ "The man was carrying on his shoulder a lamb that he had grilled."

### <a name="Imp">`Imp`</a>: imperfective

The imperfective marks an unbounded process or state, seen from the point of view of its unfolding and not as a bounded or completed event. It can be used in any temporal context, past, present or future.

#### Example

- _uːn uː= tak / doːr han kan -aː =ji <b>ki=</b> i- ki / ti= takat hiːs =heːb =ajt //_ "this man <b>had</b> not even recognized me because he thought I was the woman."

### <a name="Perf">`Perf`</a>: perfect

The perfect has a resultative value. The process or state is considered as having an impact on the moment of enunciation or another moment given by the context.

#### Example

- _kak jʔ <b>-aː</b> =b =wa ?_ "how have you come ?"

### <a name="Pfv">`Pfv`</a>: perfective

The perfective marks a bounded process or state, independently of any temporal benchmark.

#### Example

-  _tak / kaːm =i / hoː kʷiɖ -ja i- <b>ni</b> //_ "A man said: 'My camel disappeared.' "
