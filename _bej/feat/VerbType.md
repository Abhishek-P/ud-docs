We already split auxiliary and non-auxiliary verbs at the level of UPOS tags.
The `VerbType` feature may be used to capture finer distinctions that some
tagsets make.

### <a name="Aux">`Aux`</a>: auxiliary verb

Verb used to create periphrastic verb forms (tenses, passives etc.)

#### Examples
- _uːn uː= kaːm iraːnaj / fidig -a <b>dʔi</b> -jaː =b =u /_ "Gosh, this camel was let loose [and]"


### <a name="Cop">`Cop`</a>: copula verb

Verb used to make nominal predicates.
We have treated copulas as auxiliaries, this feature is used to distinguish them from other auxiliaries.

#### Examples
- _hoː =b hoːsoː ʃʔag -aː =b <b>=u</b> uː= tak _ "The man was carrying on his shoulder a lamb"


### <a name="Light">`Light`</a>: light (support) verb

Light or support verb is used in verbo-nominal constructions where the main part of the meaning
is contributed by a noun complement but it is not just a nominal predicate with a copula.

#### Examples
- _ j= ʔar han hus i- <b>kati</b> -na /_ "The children also keep quiet"
