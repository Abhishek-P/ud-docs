Three different classes of infixed pronoun are used in Old Irish; A, B, and C, as well as one pseudo-class used only after certain negative particles. These classes of pronoun are only occur infixed within the verbal complex. All three classes of infixed pronoun, and the fourth pseudo-class, are therefore distinct from independent pronouns. Accordingly, this feature is not utilised with independent pronouns, only those which are infixed.

### <a name="A">`A`</a>: Class A

Infixed pronouns of Class A follow preverbs and particles which historically ended in vowels, including _<b>ar</b>_, _<b>di</b>_, _<b>do</b>_, _<b>fo</b>_, _<b>imm</b>_, _<b>ní</b>_, _<b>no</b>_, and _<b>ro</b>_.

The original final vowels of _<b>ar</b>_ and _<b>imm</b>_ resurface when these preverbs are followed by infixed pronouns which begin with a consonant. For example, _<b>ar</b>_ can become _<b>ara</b>_, _<b>ari</b>_, _<b>aro</b>_, or _<b>aru</b>_, and _<b>imm</b>_ can take the forms _<b>immu</b>_, and _<b>mmi</b>_.

Combination with the 3rd sg. masculine or neuter Class A infixed pronouns causes reduction in the form of some preceding preverbs and particles. _<b>di</b>_, _<b>do</b>_, _<b>fo</b>_, _<b>no</b>_, and _<b>ro</b>_ become _<b>d</b>_, _<b>d</b>_, _<b>f</b>_, _<b>n</b>_, and _<b>r</b>_ respectively. By contrast, 3rd sg. masculine or neuter Class A infixed pronouns themselves are reduced orthographically to ∅ directly after the negative particle _<b>ní</b>_, though following words are still affected by initial mutations from the reduced pronouns.

#### Examples

* _do + <b>m</b> + beir_ = _do<b>m</b>beir_ "he gives <b>me</b> (to ...)"
* _do + <b>a</b> + beir_ = _d<b>a</b>beir_ “he gives <b>it</b> (to ...)”
* _ní + <b>a</b> + fagaib_ = _níḟagaib_ “he does not find <b>it</b>”

### <a name="B">`B`</a>: Class B

Infixed pronouns of Class B follow preverbs and particles which historically ended in consonants, including _<b>ad</b>_, _<b>as</b>_, _<b>con</b>_, _<b>etar</b>_, _<b>for</b>_, _<b>fri</b>_, and _<b>in</b>_.

Combination with Class B infixed pronouns causes reduction in the form of certain preceding preverbs and particles, for example, _<b>ad</b>_, _<b>as</b>_, and _<b>in</b>_ become _<b>a</b>_, and _<b>con</b>_ becomes _<b>co</b>_.

#### Examples

* _for + <b>dom</b> + cain_ = _for<b>dom</b>cain_ “he teaches <b>me</b>”
* _ad + <b>tot</b> + chí_ = _a<b>tot</b>chí_ “he sees <b>you</b>”
* _as + <b>t</b> + biur_ = _a<b>t</b>biur_ "I speak <b>it</b>"

### <a name="C">`C`</a>: Class C

Class C infixed pronouns are reserved for use in relative constructions, or following the interrogative particle, _<b>in</b>_. This does not restrict the use of other classes in relative constructions, for example, Class A is common in relative clauses also.

#### Examples

* _fo + <b>d</b> + dáli_ = _fo<b>t</b> dáli_ “which distributes <b>it</b>”
* _do + <b>da</b> + aidlea_ = _do<b>da</b>aidlea_ “who <b>visits</b> her”
* _no + <b>don</b> + nerta_ = _no<b>don</b>nerta_ “who strengthens <b>us</b>”

### <a name="Neg">`Neg`</a>: Negative

A fourth pseudo-class of infixed pronouns is used following only the negative formation, _<b>nach</b>_. This formation replaces the negative particles _<b>ná</b>_ in negative imperative constructions, and _<b>nád</b>_ in negative interrogative and relative constructions where it is necessary to infix a pronoun.

Aspects of this negative class are comparable to those of other classes. For example, as with Class A infixed pronouns, no 3rd sg. masculine pronominal form occurs directly after the negative _<b>nach</b>_. Neuter forms, _<b>id</b>_ and _<b>did</b>_ may occur after _<b>nach</b>_ and _<b>na</b>_ respectively, or can be omitted after _<b>nach</b>_ like the masculine form. In either case, if the pronoun is reduced to ∅, following words are still affected by initial mutations from the otherwise absent pronouns.

#### Examples

* _nach + <b>ib</b> + berar_ = _nach<b>ib</b> berar_ “let <b>ye</b> not be brought”
* _in + nád + <b>am</b> + carai_ = _innach<b>am</b>carai_ “do you not love <b>me</b>?”
* _ná + <b>?</b> + dermainte_ = _nach ṅdermainte_ “do not forget <b>him</b>”
