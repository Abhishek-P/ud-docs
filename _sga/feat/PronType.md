A wide variety of pronouns, and particles and other parts-of-speech with pronominal characteristics can be identified in Old Irish.

### <a name="Ana">`Ana`</a>: anaphoric

The anaphoric pronoun, _<b>suide</b>_, in its various forms, is used in Old Irish to refer back to something which has already been mentioned.

#### Examples

* _inne hi <b>suidiu</b>_ “the aforementioned things”
* _acennbart <b>són</b>_ “the aforementioned headscarf”

### <a name="Art">`Art`</a>: articles

Pronominal articles in Old Irish include all forms of the definite article, whether they form close compounds with preceding prepositions or not.

#### Examples

* _<b>in</b> ferr_ “the man”
* _do<b>nd</b> ḟiur_ “to the man”
* _<b>ind</b> ḟir_ “the men”
* _do<b>naib</b> feraib_ “to the men”

### <a name="Dem">`Dem`</a>: demonstrative

Demonstrative particles, _so_ and _sin_, are enclitics comparable to the demonstrative pronouns of other languages. These have substantival force when used alone, _amal <b>sin</b>_ "like that", or with the article, _in<b>sin</b> "that". Following other parts of speech they serve to specify something in particular, _in lebor_ "the book" but _in lebor <b>so</b>_ "<b>this</b> book".

#### Examples

* _do ndligud <b>so</b>_ “to <b>this</b> law”
* _int í <b>siu</b>_ “<b>this</b> (thing)”
* _a nainmm <b>sin</b>_ “<b>that</b> noun/name”
* _in<b>so</b>_ “<b>this</b>/<b>here</b>”
* _co<b>se</b>_ “to <b>this</b>”
* _briathra grecdi <b>se</b>_ “<b>these</b> greek words”

### <a name="Emp">`Emp`</a>: emphatic

Old Irish has emphasising particles, however, as they inflect for person and number they meet the criteria to be considered pronouns in Universal Dependencies, and are POS-tagged as such. These enclitic particles are used to emphasise pronouns, verbal subjects and objects, and the pronominal elements of conjugated prepositions (prepositional pronouns).

#### Examples

* _mei<b>sse</b>_ “<b>me</b>”
* _rosechestar <b>som</b>_ “which <b>he</b> has followed”
* _duit<b>so</b>_ “to <b>you</b>”
* _inna luc<b>som</b>_ “in <b>its</b> place”

### <a name="Ind">`Ind`</a>: indefinite

Old Irish has a specific independent pronoun, _nech_/_ní_, "someone/something", and several other independent pronominals.

#### Examples

* _adcither <b>nech</b>_ “that <b>a person</b> is seen”
* _<b>cechtar</b> in da leithe sin_ “<b>each</b> of these two parts”
* _cosmail leiss <b>cacha</b> orr_ “alike to him <b>whichever</b> he may slay”
* _etir in dobrethir <b>sechi</b>ssí_ “between <b>any</b> adverb”

### <a name="Int">`Int`</a>: interrogative

Interrogative pronouns are used when asking questions.

#### Examples

* _<b>c</b>indas ṁbias_ “<b>how</b>, then, will...?”
* _<b>Caní</b> románda_ “<b>is it not</b> Roman?”
* _<b>im</b> mascul fá femen_ “<b>is it</b> a masculine or feminine (noun)?”
* _<b>in</b> mesorsa_ “<b>will</b> I judge?”

### <a name="Prs">`Prs`</a>: personal

Several types of personal pronoun are used in Old Irish, including independent pronouns, infixed pronouns, suffixed pronouns, and possessive pronouns. Conjugated prepositions (prepositional pronouns) also have a personal pronominal element.

#### Examples

* _ce <b>hé</b> roscríb_ “who is <b>it</b> that has written”
* _it <b>é</b> inna noi_ “<b>these</b> are the nine”
* _immechomarcar <b>duit</b>_ “which is asked <b>to you</b>”
* _in cummasc <b>and</b> som_ “the confusion <b>in it</b>”
* _<b>a</b>thitol_ “<b>its</b> title”
* _uit <b>mo</b> chrob_ “ouch! <b>my</b> hand”
* _fo<b>m</b>chain lóid luin lúad_ “a blackbird's lay sings <b>me</b> praise”
* _d<b>a</b>gníusa_ “I say <b>it</b>”

### <a name="Rel">`Rel`</a>: relative

The copula in Old Irish has relative forms and can inflect for person and number.

#### Examples

* _<b>as</b>mmé moínur_ “<b>that it is</b> I alone”
* _na<b>mba</b> olcc amenma frimm_ “that his feeling <b>may be</b> not bad towards me”

### <a name="Void">`Void`</a>: void pronoun

A semantically empty pronominal form, _d_, occurs within the verbal complex following the conjunctions _cía_ "although" and _má_ "if", if no infixed pronoun already occurs there. It is infixed at the same place that a regular infixed pronoun would be expected, and is supported by the semantically empty conjunct particle _no_ if necessary.

#### Examples

* _ceno<b>d</b>fil_ “though there is”
* _manu<b>d</b> chinni_ “if it determines”
* _ciado<b>d</b>chommar foi_ “though we have gone under it”
