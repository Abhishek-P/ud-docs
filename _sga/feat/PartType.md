Several types of particle exist in Old Irish, many of which may take the same form but serve distinct functions. These include the augment, _ro_ (whether it occurs within a verb token or in isolation), the deictic particle, _í_, the numeric particle, _a_, as well as various preverbs and conjunct particles including _ad_, _as_, _do_, and _no_.

### <a name="Aug">`Aug`</a>: augment

The augment is a particle which is used within the verbal complex. It serves a variety of grammatical purposes, for example, giving perfective force to a verb. It’s most frequent form is _<b>ro</b>_.

#### Examples

* _<b>ro</b>scríb_ “that has written”
* _<b>ro</b>cinnius_ “I have defined”
* _<b>ro</b>bae_ “has been”

### <a name="Dct">`Dct`</a>: deictic

The deictic particle, _í_, refers back to a previously mentioned person or thing.

#### Examples

* _a <b>ní</b> sin_ “that (aforementioned thing)”
* _isnaib <b>hí</b>_ “in those (aforementioned thing)”
* _dond <b>í</b>_ “to that (thing)”

### <a name="Nas">`Nas`</a>: nasal

Many instances occur in manuscripts where a nasal, _<b>ṅ</b>_ or _<b>ṁ</b>_, will stand apart from both the following and preceding words. These can be sparated by spacing, or by enclosing puncta. While such nasals normally form the anlaut of the following word, this orthographic separation forces them to be treated as discrete tokens which are POS-tagged as particles.

#### Examples

* _conducaid etargne <b>ṅ</b> dǽ_ “that you might understand the knowledge of God”
* _doairchet allaa <b>ṁ</b> brithemnacte_ “the day of judgement has been foretold”
* _in tan <b>·m·</b> bís_ “when there is”

### <a name="Num">`Num`</a>: numeric

These precede cardinal numbers when counting.

#### Examples

* _<b>a</b> tri_ “three”
* _<b>a</b> noi_ “nine”

### <a name="Rel">`Rel`</a>: relative

The relative particle, _a_, is used syntactically between a preposition and a verb.

Negative relative particles, _nád_, also occur, however, these are not preceded by prepositions.

#### Examples

* _hu<b>a</b> nainmnigter_ “from which is named”
* _as<b>a</b> nairberar_ “out of which is drawn”
* _di<b>a</b> nacomlatar_ “to which they are added”
* _<b>nad</b> fodlaiter_ “which are not derived”
* _<b>nad</b> ṁbíet_ “which will not be”

### <a name="Vb">`Vb`</a>: verbal

A variety of preverbs are treated as verbal particles, including the "empty" preverb, _no_, used to infix pronouns where no preverb or conjunct particle would otherwise be present.

#### Examples

* _<b>do</b>gní_ “it makes/does”
* _<b>at</b>tá di ṡeirc_ “it is for love”
* _ce<b>nu</b>d sluindi_ “although it signifies”

### <a name="Voc">`Voc`</a>: vocative

The vocative particle, _<b>a</b>_, is used to directly address a person or thing.

#### Examples

* _<b>a</b>nóibingen_ "O Holy Virgin"
* _<b>a</b> rómanu_ "Romans!"
* _<b>a</b>thusu_ "You!"
