In Nheengatu, compounds are hyphenated orthographical words and generally correspond to a single syntactic word. Some auxiliaries, however, incorporate into the main verb, building a complex verb, reminiscent of V-V compound verbs in Japanese (Kageyama, 2016). In these auxiliary verb constructions of Nheengatu, only the main verb inflects for person and number, the auxiliary remaining in its basic (non-finite) form. These auxiliary forms are marked with `Compound=Yes`.

### <a name="Yes">`Yes`</a>: non-finite auxiliary form in a V-V compound

#### Examples

* _Pitunawasú ramé ti **yaxipiaka-kwáu** maã.&nbsp;_  "When it's dark we can't see anything." (Hartt, 362, adap., apud Avila, 2021)

* _**Ayuíri-putari** se retama kití.&nbsp;_  "I want to return to my land." (Moore et al., 1994, adap.)

The highlighted verb compounds have two components:  the inflected main verb and the non-inflected auxiliary, _<b>yaxipiaka</b>_ '1p:see' and _<b>kwáu</b>_ 'can' in the former example, _<b>ayuíri</b>_ '1s:return' and _<b>putari</b>_ 'want' in the latter, respectively. The second component, the auxiliary verb, is assigned `Compound=Yes`. The first component, the main verb with the 1st person singular active prefix, is assigned number and person features, but not `Compound=Yes`.
