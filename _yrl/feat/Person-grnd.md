`Person[grnd]` encodes the person of the internal argument of a postpostion, i.e., the reference object, *relatum*  or *ground* (also *landmark* in cognitive grammar), which is realized in Nheengatu in certain circunstances by the non-contiguity prefix *s-*. These postposition forms correspond to a prepositional phrase formed by a preposition and a personal pronoun in languages such as English.

### <a name="1">`1`</a>: first person ground

This is realized by an inactive prefix, also called second class pronoun.

#### Examples

* _Ape ana suú-itá umamana ixé, upuãmu uyuyari <b>se resé</b> useréu arama aé.&nbsp;_  "At that moment the animals surrounded me, stood up against me to lick him." (Amorim, 181, adap., apud Avila 2021)

### <a name="2">`2`</a>: second person ground

This is expressed by a second class pronoun.

#### Examples

* _[...] pe ruayana yuruparí uyatimana <b>pe ruakí</b> kwayé leão usasemu waá yawé, [...].&nbsp;_  "[...] the devil, your enemy, walks around you like a roaring lion, [...]." (O Novo Testamento em nyengatu, 1 Pedro 5:8, adap., apud Avila 2021)

### <a name="3">`3`</a>: third person ground

A pronominal third person ground is incorporated into the postpostion in form of the non-contiguity prefx *s*.

#### Examples

* _Kunhã-itá upuapuãmu <b>suakí</b> rupí umaã arama aé umungitá aintá.&nbsp;_ "Women milled around him to see if he would court them". (Amorim, 444, adap., apud Avila 2021)
* _Waimĩ uyapí pisá <b>sesé</b>, upupeka reté aé, urasú suka kití.&nbsp;_ "The old woman threw the net over him, enveloped him completely, took him to her house." (Magalhães, 165, adap., apud Avila 2021)
