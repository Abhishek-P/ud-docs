`Rel` is a class of prefixes that combine with certain subclasses of roots. They are no longer productive. `Rel=Cont` and `Rel=NCont` occur with nouns, postpositions, and intransitive inactive verbs. They signal, respectively, the adjacency (contiguity) and non-adjacency (non-contiguity) of a head and its dependent, i.e., possessor-noun, object-postposition, and verb-subject. `Rel=Abs` is limited to nouns. It signals that the noun is used absolutely, i.e., it does not govern a genitive complement.   

### <a name="Cont">`Cont`</a>: contiguous

Contiguity is associated with certain subclasses of nouns, verbs, and postpositions.

#### Examples

* _<b>se ruka</b>&nbsp;_ “my house”
* _<b>ne retama</b>&nbsp;_ “your city”
* _<b>se ruakí</b>&nbsp;_ “near me”
* _<b>se rurí</b>&nbsp;_ “I'm happy”
* _<b>kunhã ruka</b>&nbsp;_ "the woman's house”
* _<b>paranã ruakí</b>&nbsp;_ “near the river”

### <a name="NCont">`NCont`</a>: non-contiguous

Non-contiguity is associated with certain subclasses of nouns, verbs, and postpositions.

#### Examples

* _<b>suka</b>&nbsp;_ “his/her/its house”
* _<b>setama</b>&nbsp;_ “his/her/its city”
* _<b>suakí</b>&nbsp;_ “near him/her/it”
* _<b>surí</b>&nbsp;_ “He/she/it is happy”

### <a name="Abs">`Abs`</a>: Absolute

Absolute is associated with certain subclasses of nouns, being phonetically empty (zero alomorph) in some cases.

#### Examples

* _<b> aintá usikí aé tetama suí (O Novo Testamento em nyengatu, Acts 14:19, apud Avila 2021)</b> &nbsp;_ “they dragged him outside the city”
* _<b>Yané kupixawa apekatú uka suí (Hartt, 377, apud Avila 2021)</b> &nbsp;_ “Our plantation is far from home.”
