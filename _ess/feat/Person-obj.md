The Yupik transitive verb inflects for the person (and number) of object. If object is provided as a separate noun, it agrees with the verb ending in person (and number).

### <a name="1">`1`</a>: first person object

#### Examples
* [ess] _Aghnalqwaaghem <b>ungipaataanga</b> an'gighniluten._ "The old woman <b>told me</b> you had played outside." The verb ending _-anga_ `Number[obj]=Sing|Person[obj]=1` in _ungipaataanga_ "she told me" encodes that the object is first person singular ("me").

### <a name="2">`2`</a>: second person object

#### Examples

* [ess] _<b>Esghaghlleqamken</b>._ "<b>I will see you</b>." The verb ending _-mken_ `Number[obj]=Sing|Person[obj]=2` in _Esghaghlleqamken_ encodes that the object is second person singular ("you").

### <a name="3">`3`</a>: third person object

#### Examples

* [ess] _<b>Neghaqa</b> perara ellnginaan._ "<b>I ate</b> the meat aspic only." The verb ending _qa_ `Person[obj]=3` in _neghaqa_ agrees with the object _perara_ "meat aspic" in person.
