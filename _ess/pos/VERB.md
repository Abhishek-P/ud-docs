### Definition

A verb is a member of the syntactic class of words that typically signal events and actions, can constitute a minimal predicate in a clause, and govern the number and types of other constituents which may occur in the clause.

### Examples

* _tagi-_ "to come (base)"
* _tagiit_ "they came"
* _tagiiqngan_ "when it/he/she came"

If a word is further analyzed into morphemes, verb-yielding derivational morphemes are tagged as `VERB`. These include verb-elaborating suffixes (V→V) that attach to verbal roots and yield verbal bases and verbalizing suffixes (N→V) that attach to nominal roots and yield verbal bases.

### Examples

* _-yug(V→V)_ "to want to V" (as in _mayughyugtuq_ "he wants to climb")
* _-lgu(N→V)_ "to have N" (as in _siguteghllalguut_ "they have big ears")
