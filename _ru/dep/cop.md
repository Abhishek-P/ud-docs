A copula is the relation between the nominal predicate and
the copular verb _<b>быть</b>_ “to be”. Note that in present tense copula is often omitted. 
The verbs _являться_ “to be”, _становиться_ “to become”, despite being counted among copular verbs by some authors,
is not analyzed as `cop`.

We normally take a copula as a dependent of its complement (the nominal predicate).
The nominal predicate is usually a [noun](ru-pos/NOUN), an [adjective](ru-pos/ADJ)
or a <a href="../feat/VerbForm.html#part-participle">participle</a>.

Андрей был честным человеком . \n Andrew was an honest man .
cop(человеком, был)
cop(man, was)

The nominal predicate may also be expressed using a prepositional phrase.
Phrases expressing the state of the subject are clear predicates, e.g. _Я была не в форме_ “I was out of shape”.
Under the v2 guidelines, prepositional phrases expressing locations are also considered predicates, to increase parallelism across languages.

Thus the following sentences receive parallel analyses:

- _Я была редактором._ “I was an editor.”
- _Я была не в форме._ “I was out of shape”.
- _Я была на кухне._ “I was in the kitchen.”

In contrast, the following two sentences are no longer parallel:

- _Я была на кухне._ “I was in the kitchen.”
- _Я осталась на кухне._ “I stayed in the kitchen.”
