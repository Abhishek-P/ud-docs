# UD for Ancient Hebrew <span class="flagspan"><img class="flag" src="../../flags/svg/IL.svg" /></span>

## Tokenization and Word Segmentation

No tokens in the Ancient Hebrew treebank should contain whitespace. The following are made into separate tokens:

* Prepositions (ב, כ, ל, מ)
* Possessive and object pronouns (ני, נו, ו, ם, ...)
  * The corresponding independent pronoun is used as the lemma
* Conjunction ו
* Definite determiner ה
  * This includes ה when it appears as demonstrative agreement on adjectives, participles, and demonstrative determiners
  * Since the text includes vowels diacritics, ה is included as a token even when it does not correspond to a full character in the consonantal text.

## Morphology

### Tags

All tags are used except `X` and `SYM`. `AUX` is used for the copula היה.

The positive and negative existentials ישׁ and אין are tagged [VERB]().

Participles are tagged either [VERB]() or [NOUN](). If they have arguments or obliques, they are tagged as [VERB](), but if they do not then they are tagged as [NOUN]() if they participate in nominal phrases.

The correspondences between XPOS ([BHSA feature `sp`](https://etcbc.github.io/bhsa/features/sp/)) and UPOS are listed below.
Rows prefixed with → indicate that the part of speech tag's correspondence is conditioned by the [BHSA lexical set feature](https://etcbc.github.io/bhsa/features/ls/).
