Adjectives are words that typically modify nouns and specify their properties or attributes. If adjectives function as predicates, they became [qualitative verbs](VERB).

The `ADJ` tag is intended for ordinary adjectives only, see [DET]() for determiners and [NUM]() for numerals.

In Bambara, adjectives are always postposed.
