Traditional grammars of Slavic languages do not distinguish pronouns (`PRON`) from pro-adjectives (determiners, `DET`),
hence it is important to define a consistent borderline here. (Some authors, e.g. Sussex and Cubberley (2006) do use
the term _determiner_ in Slavic languages but they rely on common understanding without precisely delimiting them.)

In order to provide the broader picture, we describe both pronouns and determiners on one page: [sla-pos/PRON]().
