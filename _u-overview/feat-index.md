# Universal features

{% include u-feat-table.html %}

This page lists features that have been acknowledged as “universal” in the universal part of the
UD guidelines. This does not mean that they occur in all languages. It means that they have been
attested in more than one language and they are considered linguistically important. UD treebanks
may use additional features and values if they are properly documented. Typically, they are
described in language-specific UD documentation, although some non-universal features may also
have globally accessible description pages.
