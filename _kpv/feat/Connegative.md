Boolean feature of verbs ([VERB]() and [AUX]()), marking a word as
being in connegative form.

In Komi-Zyrian, negations are formed from the auxiliary negative verb (*оз*)
and the main verb, the latter of which typically appears in
connegative form.

### <a name="Yes">`Yes`</a>: word is connegative

Note that there is no `No` value. If the word is not connegative, the
`Connegative` feature will not appear.

#### Examples

* [kpv] _ог <b>тӧд</b>_ "I don't <b>know</b>"
