`det:mod` has been used for possessive determiners, but it must be replaced by `det` with the [feature](https://universaldependencies.org/en/feat/Poss.html) `Poss=Yes` on the determiner.
See also `nmod:poss` about the [possessive construction](https://universaldependencies.org/u/dep/nmod-poss.html#nmod-poss-possessive-nominal-modifier).
