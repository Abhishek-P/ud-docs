An adjectival modifier of a noun (or pronoun) is any adjectival phrase that serves
to modify the noun (or pronoun). The relation applies whether the meaning of the noun 
is modified in a compositional way (e.g., _large house_) or an idiomatic way (_hot dogs_).

An `amod` dependent may have its own modifiers (e.g., _very large house_) but the dependent should not be a clause. If it is a clause, then `acl` should be used.
