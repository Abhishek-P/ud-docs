An adverbial modifier of a word is a (non-clausal) [adverb](u-pos/ADV)
or adverbial phrase that serves to modify a predicate or a modifier word.

In some situations in some languages, a limited set of adverbs can also
modify nominals (e.g., _<b>only</b> on Monday_). The `advmod` relation or
its subtype has to be used in such cases, too (see also [advmod:emph]()).

Note that in some grammatical traditions, the term _adverbial modifier_ covers
constituents that function like adverbs regardless whether they are realized
by adverbs, adpositional phrases, or nouns in particular morphological
[cases](u-feat/Case).
We differentiate adverbials realized as adverbs _(advmod)_ and
adverbials realized by noun phrases or adpositional phrases
([obl]()). However, we do not differentiate between modifiers of predicates
(adverbials in a narrow sense) and modifiers of other modifier words like
adjectives or adverbs (sometime called qualifiers). These functions are all
subsumed under `advmod`.
