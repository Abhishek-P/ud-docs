Reflexive pronouns (see the feature [cs-feat/Reflex]()) are used in various constructions in Czech,
including so-called _reflexive passive._
In PDT, their relation to the verb is labeled `AuxR`.
The corresponding label in Czech UD is called `expl:pass`
(since UD 2.0; in previous versions it was labeled `auxpass:reflex`).
