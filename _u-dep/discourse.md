This is used for [interjections](u-pos/INTJ) and other discourse [particles](u-pos/PART) and
elements (which are not clearly linked to the structure of the
sentence, except in an expressive way). In English, for example, this includes:
interjections (*oh*, *uh-huh*, *Welcome*), fillers (*um*, *ah*),
and non-adverbial discourse markers (*well*, *like*, but not *you know* or *actually*).
We also use `discourse` for list enumerators (e.g. *1.*, *(a)* marking an item in a sequence).
(Bullets, by contrast, are considered [punctuation](u-pos/PUNCT) and attach as [punct]().)

These discourse elements are attached to the head of the most relevant nearby unit, often a clause.
