This relation applies to a relative clause that modifies a clause (as opposed to typical relative clauses, which are adnominal and use [acl:relcl]()).

For example, the antecedent is a clause in:

~~~ sdparse
I tried to explain myself – which was a bad idea .
advcl:relcl(tried, idea)
nsubj(idea, which)
~~~
