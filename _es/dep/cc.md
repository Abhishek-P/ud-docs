A coordination is the relation between an element of coordination and the coordinating conjunction
word of the conjunct. (Note: different dependency grammars have different treatments of
coordination. We take one conjunct of coordination as the head of the coordination.)
A conjunction may also appear at the beginning of a sentence. This is also called a `cc`,
and it depends on the root predicate of the sentence.
