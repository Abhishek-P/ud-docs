Person is a lexical feature of personal and possessive [pronouns](PRON) and [determiners](DET), and an inflectional feature of [auxiliaries](AUX) and [verbs](VERB).


### <a name="1">`1`</a>: first person

In Spanish, the first person singular (yo, "I") and first person plural (nosotros/nosotras, "we") represent the speaker. It denotes the person or group that is speaking or writing. This is reflected in the verb forms, which are inflected to show the first person.

#### Examples

* _Yo hablo_ "I speak"
* _Nosotros comemos_ "We eat"


### <a name="2">`2`</a>: second person

The second person singular (tú, "you") and second person plural (vosotros/vosotras, "you all") in Spanish represent the person or people that the speaker is talking to. This is reflected in the verb forms, which are inflected to show the second person.

#### Examples

* _Tú comes_ "You eat"
* _Vosotros habláis_ "You all speak"


### <a name="3">`3`</a>: third person

In Spanish, the third person singular (él/ella/ello, "he/she/it") and third person plural (ellos/ellas, "they") represent someone or something that is neither the speaker nor the addressee. This is reflected in the verb forms, which are inflected to show the third person.

#### Examples

* _Él habla_ "He speaks"
* _Ellas comen_ "They eat"
