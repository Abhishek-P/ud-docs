Principally, `VerbForm` is an inflectional feature of [verbs](VERB) and [auxiliaries](AUX), however, it is also used as a lexical feature of some [adjectives](ADJ) and [adverbs](ADV).


### <a name="Fin">`Fin`</a>: finite verb

Verbs that have a non-empty [Mood]() are considered finite.Verbs t Finite verbs are those that are inflected to show agreement with the subject and indicate tense, mood, and sometimes aspect. They typically represent actions or states that are performed or experienced by the subject.

#### Examples

* _Él canta_ "He sings"
* _Ella comió_ "She ate"
* _Él irá_ "He will go"


### <a name="Inf">`Inf`</a>: infinitive

Infinitive is the citation form of verbs. It is the base form of the verb that appears in dictionaries and serves as a non-finite verb form. Infinitives are often used as the argument of modal and other verbs.

* _cantar_ "to sing"
* _comer_ "to eat"
* _ir_ "to go"


### <a name="Part">`Part`</a>: participle

#### Examples

* _cantado_ "sung"
* _comido_ "eaten"
* _ido_ "gone"


### <a name="Ger">`Ger`</a>: gerund

* _cantando_ "singing"
