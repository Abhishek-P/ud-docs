Mood is a feature that expresses modality and subclassifies finite verb forms. It is an inflectional feature of [auxiliaries](AUX) and [verbs](VERB).


### <a name="Ind">`Ind`</a>: indicative

The indicative can be considered the default mood. A verb in indicative merely states that something happens, has happened or will happen, without adding any attitude of the speaker.

#### Examples

* _Yo hablo español._ "I speak Spanish."
* _Ellos comieron pizza._ "They ate pizza."
* _Nosotros iremos al cine._ "We will go to the movies."


### <a name="Imp">`Imp`</a>: imperative

The speaker uses imperative to order or ask the addressee to do the action of the verb.

#### Examples

* _Habla más despacio._ "Speak more slowly."
* _Come tu cena._ "Eat your dinner."
* _Vayan a casa._ "Go home."


### <a name="Sub">`Sub`</a>: subjunctive

The subjunctive mood is used to express various states of unreality such as doubt, possibility, necessity, or action that has not yet occurred.

#### Examples

* _Espero que tú hables español._ "I hope that you speak Spanish."
* _Dudo que ellos coman pizza._ "I doubt that they eat pizza."
* _Es necesario que nosotros vayamos al cine._ "It is necessary that we go to the movies."


### <a name="Cnd">`Cnd`</a>: conditional

Generally, the conditional mood is used to express actions that would have taken place under some circumstances but they actually did not / do not happen.

#### Examples

* _Yo hablaría español si pudiera._ "I would speak Spanish if I could."
* _Ellos comerían pizza si tuvieran hambre._ "They would eat pizza if they were hungry."
* _Nosotros iríamos al cine si tuviéramos tiempo._ "We would go to the movies if we had time."
