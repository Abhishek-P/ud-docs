Possessive [pronouns](PRON) and [determiners](DET) may have two different numbers: that of the possessed object (in
agreement with the modified noun, inflectional feature) and that of the possessor (inherent, lexical feature). The
`Number[psor]` feature denotes the possessor's number.


### <a name="Sing">`Sing`</a>: singular possessor

In Spanish, specific possessive determiners are used for singular possessors in the first and second person. The
third-person possessive, _su_, is common for singular and plural possessors.

#### Examples

* _Mi libro_ "My book"
* _Mis libros_ "My books"
* _Tu coche_ "Your (singular) car"
* _Su casa_ "His/Her house"


### <a name="Plur">`Plur`</a>: plural possessor

Similarly, when the possessor is plural, other specific determiners are used in the first and second person.

#### Examples

* _Nuestro libro_ "Our book"
* _Nuestros libros_ "Our books"
* _Vuestro coche_ "Your (plural) car"
* _Su casa_ "Their house"
