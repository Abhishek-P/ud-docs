The Foreign feature marks tokens that are not native to the text's language. These can include borrowed words, code-switching, or entire phrases in another language. In the context of the Spanish Universal Dependencies treebank, the Foreign feature would be applied to words that are not part of the Spanish language but appear in the text.

### <a name="Yes">`Yes`</a>: it is foreign

Boolean feature. Is this a foreign word?
