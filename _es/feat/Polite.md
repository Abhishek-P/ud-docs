### <a name="Form">`Form`</a>: formal register

In Spanish, the pronouns _usted_ and _ustedes_ are used when addressing someone in a formal or respectful manner. This
is usually done when communicating with people of higher social status, older age, or in situations that require
a certain degree of formality (e.g., a business meeting, a formal event, or when speaking to a stranger).

#### Examples

* _¿Usted desea algo más?_ "Do you [formal] want anything else?"
* _Ustedes deben completar el trabajo._ "You [plural, formal] must complete the work."
* _¿Cómo está usted?_ "How are you [formal]?"

However, it's worth noting that the use of _usted_ and _ustedes_ can vary greatly across different Spanish-speaking
regions. In some dialects, _ustedes_ is used as the standard second person plural pronoun, replacing the more informal
_vosotros_. Also, while _usted_ and _ustedes_ are traditionally associated with formality and respect, their usage can
also be common in everyday conversation in certain regions, without necessarily implying a higher level of formality.

Therefore, in the UD Spanish treebanks, _usted_ and _ustedes_ are tagged with the feature `Polite=Form` to indicate
their typical association with formal register, but the interpretation of this feature in a specific context may depend
on regional usage and sociolinguistic factors.
