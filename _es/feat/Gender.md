In Spanish Gender is a lexical feature of [nouns](NOUN) and [proper nouns](PROPN), and an inflectional feature of other parts of speech ([adjectives](ADJ), [verbs](VERB), [auxiliary](AUX), [pronouns](PRON), [determiners](DET) and [numerals](NUM)) that mark agreement with nouns.

Nouns, adjectives, pronouns, determiners, and numerals inflect for masculine or feminine gender. This inflection often involves an -a for feminine -o for masculine ending for nouns and adjectives, though there are exceptions.

Furthermore, masculine gender is used as a generic form in many contexts. The grammatical concept of gender in Spanish involves agreement (concordance) between different elements of a sentence. This means that adjectives, determiners, and pronouns must match the gender of the noun they refer to


### <a name="Masc">`Masc`</a>: masculine gender

#### Examples

* _El gato negro_ "The black cat"
* _Un libro grande_ "A big book"
* _Su hermano mayor_ "His older brother"


### <a name="Fem">`Fem`</a>: feminine gender

#### Examples

* _La gata negra_ "The black female cat"
* _Una manzana grande_ "A big apple"
* _Su hermana mayor_ "Her older sister"
