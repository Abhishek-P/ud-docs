### Definition

A subordinating conjunction is a conjunction that links constructions by making one of them a constituent of the other. The subordinating conjunction typically marks the incorporated constituent which has the status of a "subordinate" clause.

In Spanish, we recognize these two subclasses as subordinating conjunctions:

* Complementizers, such as _como_ "like", _que_ "that", _mientras_ "while", _si_ "if".
* Adverbial clause introducers, such as _como_ "like", _cuando_ "when", _ya que_ "since" or _porque_ "because" when introducing a clause, not a nominal.

For coordinating conjunctions, see [CCONJ]().
