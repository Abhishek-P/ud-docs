An auxiliary verb, as the name suggests, assists the main verb in a sentence. Its primary function is not to convey a semantic meaning but to deliver grammatical or functional details including tense, aspect, mood, number, person, and voice. A defining characteristic of auxiliary verbs is that they do not subcategorize for the subject or other sentence complements.

In Spanish, typical examples of auxiliary verbs include _ser_ and _estar_ "to be" used as copulas, _haber_ for perfect tenses, and modal verbs like _poder_ "can" and _deber_ "must". However, it's essential to note that if a verb retains its semantic content, it's classified as a VERB and not an AUX, as might be the case with _coser_ "to sew".

Moreover, some verbs, termed _semiauxiliars,_ partake in periphrastic constructions, contributing to the overall meaning of the verb phrase. Despite their supportive role, these semiauxiliars might still be tagged as VERBS due to their maintained semantic contribution.

* Spanish auxiliary verbs ([AUX]()) are:
  * _ser_ and _estar_ “to be”, used as copulas
  * _ser_ “to be” for the passive (_la sentencia fue publicada_ “the sentence was published”)
  * _estar_ “to be” for the progressive (_mis hijos están estudiando inglés_ “my children are studying English”)
  * _haber_ “to be/have” for the perfect tenses (_ha venido hoy_ “he came today”)
