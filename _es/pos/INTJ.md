### Definition

An interjection is a word that is used most often as an exclamation or part of an exclamation. It typically expresses an emotional reaction, is not syntactically related to other accompanying expressions, and may include a combination of sounds not otherwise found in the language.

Note that words primarily belonging to another part of speech retains their original category when used in exclamations. For example, in the phrase _¡Dios mío!_, _Dios_ is a [NOUN]() and _mío_ is a [PRON]() even in exclamatory uses.

As a special case of interjections, we recognize feedback particles such as _sí_ and _no_. Note that uses of _sí_ and _no_ syntactically related to other accompanying expressions in a sentence are recognized as [ADV]().

### Examples

Marked as interjections:

- _psst_
- _ay_
- _bravo_
- _hola_
- _sí_, e.g. _<b>Sí</b>, porque..._ "<b>Yes</b>, because..."
- _no_, e.g. _<b>No</b>, no lo creo_ "<b>No</b>, I don't believe it."

Marked as adverbs:

- _sí_, e.g. _Votaremos <b>sí</b>_ "We will vote <b>yes</b>."
- _no_, e.g. _<b>No</b> es verdad_ "It is <b>not</b> true."

Interjections may vary across different Spanish-speaking regions. Some examples of regional interjections include:

_¡ché!_ (Argentina, Uruguay): used to get someone's attention or to express surprise
_¡ándale!_ (Mexico): used to encourage someone or express agreement
_¡vamos!_ (Spain): used to express surprise or triumph
_¡epa!_ (Venezuela, Colombia): used to express surprise or to get someone's attention

In spoken Spanish, certain words retain their original category even when used as interjections. Examples include _¡Madre mía!_ ("my mother"), _¡Mujer!_ ("woman"), _¡Hombre!_ ("man"), _¡Venga!_ ("come"), and _¡Verdad!_ ("truth)". These words are primarily nouns, verbs or adjectives, but in conversational contexts, they can function as interjections to express emotions or reactions.
