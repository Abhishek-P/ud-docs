### Definition

Coordinating conjunctions "CCONJ" are a part of speech that connects words, phrases, or clauses of equal syntactic importance within a sentence. They serve to link elements of the same type, such as two nouns, two adjectives, or two verbs, without creating a hierarchy or subordination between the connected elements.

In Spanish, common coordinating conjunctions include _y_ "and", _o_ "or", _pero_ "but", _ni_ "neither/nor", and _sino_ "but/rather". Coordinating conjunctions function to create compound sentences and coordinate different parts of the sentence, allowing for more complex and nuanced expressions.

### Examples

* _María y Juan están estudiando._ “María and Juan are studying.”
* _Quiero ir al cine, pero no tengo tiempo._ “I want to go to the movies but I don't have time.”
* _Puedes estudiar inglés o francés._ “You can study English or French.”

Note that some coordinating conjunctions, like _y_ and _o,_ can change their spelling depending on the sound of the
following word. For example, _y_ changes to _e_ when the following word begins with an _i_ sound, and _o_ changes to
_u_ when the following word begins with an _o_ sound.

### Examples

* _padre e hijo_ “father and son”
* _siete u ocho_ “seven or eight”
