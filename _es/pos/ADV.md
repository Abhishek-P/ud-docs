### Definition

Adverbs are words that typically modify [verbs](VERB) for such categories as time, place, direction or manner. They may also modify [adjectives](ADJ) (as in _<b>claramente</b> falso_ "clearly fake"), other adverbs (as in _<b>muy brevemente</b>_ "very briefly") or even [nouns](NOUN) / [pronouns](PRON) (as in _<b>solamente</b> tú_ "only you").

There is a closed subclass of _pronominal adverbs_ that refer to circumstances in context, rather than naming them directly; similarly to pronouns, these can be categorized as interrogative, relative, demonstrative, etc. To conform to the UD guidelines, pronominal adverbs also get the `ADV` part-of-speech tag but they are differentiated by additional features (see [pronominal type](PronType)).

### Examples

- _muy_ "very"
- _bien_ "well"
- _exactamente_ "exactly"
- _mañana_ "tomorrow"
- _arriba, abajo_ "up, down"
- demonstrative adverbs: _aquí, allí, ahora, después_ "here, there, now, then"
- totality adverbs: _siempre_ "always"
- negative adverbs: _nunca_ "never"

In Spanish adverbs can be derived from adjectives using the suffix  _{-mente}_, such as _<b>lentamente</b>_ ("slowly") or _<b>rápidamente</b>_ ("quickly"), or without any formal modification, where many adjectives in masculine singular form are used as adverbs, such as _hablar <b>alto</b>_ ("speak loud") or _trabajar <b>duro</b>_ ("work hard"). There are also adverbialized nouns, which are nominal forms used as adverbs, such as _pasarlo <b>bomba</b>_ ("have a blast").
