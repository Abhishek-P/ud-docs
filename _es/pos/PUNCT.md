### Definition

Punctuation marks are non-alphabetical characters and character groups used in many languages to delimit linguistic units in printed text.

Punctuation is not taken to include logograms such as _$_, _%_, and _§_, which are instead tagged as [SYM]().

### Examples

- Period: _<b>.</b>_
- Comma: _<b>,</b>_
- Parentheses: _<b>()</b>_

In Spanish, the opening question mark (¿) and the opening exclamation mark (¡) are used at the beginning of a question
or an exclamatory statement and are always paired with their corresponding closing punctuation marks at the end (? and
! respectively).

For instance:

_¿Cómo estás?_ "How are you?"
_¡Qué sorpresa!_ "What a surprise!"

These punctuation marks are always used in standard written Spanish. In some informal settings like social media or
text messages, they might be omitted, but this is not considered grammatically correct.
