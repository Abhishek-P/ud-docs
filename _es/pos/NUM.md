## Definition

A numeral is a word, functioning most typically as a determiner, pronoun, adjective, or adverb, that expresses a number and a relation to the number, such as quantity, sequence, frequency, or fraction.

In Universal Dependencies, the NUM tag is reserved for definite cardinal numerals (e.g., _uno_ "one", _dos_ "two",
_tres_ "three") including fractions (e.g., _media_ "half", _tercio_ "third"). Ordinal numbers (e.g., _primero_ "first",
_segundo_ "second", _tercero_ "third") are tagged as adjectives or adverbs. When used as adjectives, they modify a noun
and agree with the noun in gender and number. When used as adverbs, they modify a verb, adjective, or other adverb, and
do not need to agree in gender or number. Multiplicative numerals (e.g., _doble_ "double", _triple_ "triple") are also
tagged as adjectives or adverbs, not as NUM.

Most cardinal numerals in Spanish do not agree with the counted noun in gender. The exception is the numeral _uno_
"one", which changes to "una" when modifying a feminine noun.

## Examples

* Ordinal number as an adjective: _El primer día_ "The first day" (primer agrees with día in gender and number)
* Ordinal number as an adverb: _Llegó primero_ "He/She arrived first" (primero modifies the verb llegó and does not need to agree in gender or number)
