Definition
A numeral is a word, functioning most typically as a determiner, pronoun, adjective, or adverb, that expresses a number and a relation to the number, such as quantity, sequence, frequency, or fraction.

In Universal Dependencies, numerals are tagged with the NUM label. They can be cardinal (e.g., _uno_ "one", _dos_ "two", _tres_ "three"), ordinal (e.g., _primero_ "first", _segundo_ "second", _tercero_ "third"), fractions (e.g., _media_ "half", _tercio_ "third"), or multiplicative (e.g., _doble_ "double", _triple_ "triple").

In Spanish, numerals agree in gender and number with the noun they modify. For example, the numeral "uno" changes to "una" when modifying a feminine noun.

Ordinal numbers are tagged as adjectives or adverbs. When used as adjectives, they modify a noun and agree in gender and number. When used as adverbs, they modify a verb, adjective, or other adverb, and do not need to agree in gender or number.

Examples

Ordinal number as an adjective: _El primer día_ "The first day" (primer agrees with día in gender and number)
Ordinal number as an adverb: _Llegó primero_ "He/She arrived first" (primero modifies the verb llegó and does not need to agree in gender or number)
