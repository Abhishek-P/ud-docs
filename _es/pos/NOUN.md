### Definition

Nouns are a part of speech typically denoting a person, place, thing, animal or idea.

The `NOUN` tag is intended for common nouns only. See [PROPN]() for proper nouns and [PRON]() for pronouns.

Spanish nouns have the lexical feature [es-feat/Gender](). Furthermore, the nouns inflect for [es-feat/Number]().

### Examples

- _chica_ “girl”
- _gato_ “cat”
- _árbol_ “tree”
- _aire_ “air”
- _belleza_ “beauty”

Gender can be either masculine or feminine, while number can be singular or plural. Typically, masculine nouns end in "-o," while feminine nouns end in "-a," but there are exceptions and irregular nouns. The gender of a noun affects the agreement with adjectives, articles, and pronouns that modify or refer to it.
Number agreement in Spanish nouns involves adding a plural suffix, typically "-s" or "-es," to the singular form of the noun. The choice of plural suffix depends on the ending of the singular noun. 

In spoken Spanish the /s/ sound is sometimes elided, meaning it is not pronounced. This phenomenon occurs mainly in the Caribbean, some parts of South America, and some regions of Spain, such as the Canary Islands and Andalusia. When elision occurs, it can affect the form of the word and, consequently, the features assigned to it. For instance, the word  _ustedes_ "you all" can be phonologically transcribed as _ustede_ [usteðe]. If elision occurs and its represented in transcription, it is crucial to maintain concordance in the feature tags assigned to the word. In this case it should still be tagged as plural (Number=Plur) to maintain concordance with the rest of the sentence.
