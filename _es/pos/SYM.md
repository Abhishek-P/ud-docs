### Definition

A symbol is a word-like entity that differs from ordinary words by form, function, or both. Symbols are distinct from [punctuation](PUNCT) that delimit linguistic units in printed text and do not have any semantic function. What makes them different from punctuation is that they can be substituted by normal words, as in currency symbols (e.g. _<b>$</b>_) and mathematical operators (e.g. _<b>+</b>_). Symbols also include emoticons and emoji, URL and e-mail addresses, hasthags and similar.

Abbreviations for single words are not symbols but are assigned the part of speech of the full form (e.g. NOUN for _dr._). Similarly, acronyms for proper nouns (e.g. _NATO_) or common nouns (e.g. _USB_) are annotated as PROPN and NOUN, respectively.
