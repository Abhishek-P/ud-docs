### Definition

A pronoun is a word that functions as a substitute for a noun or noun phrase. Pronouns have reference to entities that are participants in an event or possessors of an attribute, without specifying them by name.

Spanish pronouns can be personal (e.g., _yo_, _tú_, _él_), reflexive (e.g., _me_, _te_, _se_), demonstrative (e.g., _este_, _ese_, _aquel_), relative (e.g., _que_, _quien_, _cual_), interrogative/exclamatory (e.g., _quién_, _qué_, _cuál_), indefinite (e.g., _alguien_, _algo_, _ninguno_), or possessive (e.g., _mío_, _tuyo_, _suyo_).

Pronouns in Spanish agree in gender, number, and sometimes case with the noun or noun phrase they replace or refer to. Pronouns can also take on different forms based on their syntactic function, such as subject, object, or possessive. Possessive pronouns always function as determiners and are denoted by the [DET]() tag. They agree in gender and number with the noun they modify and receive the feature Prontype=Poss to indicate their possessive nature.
