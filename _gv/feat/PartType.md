Manx uses many of the same particles as Irish and Scottish Gaelic,
and we have done our best to follow the annotation schemes in
those treebanks.

### <a name="Ad">`Ad`</a>: adverbial

The particle _<b>dy</b>_ is used before an adjective to create an adverbial phrase.

#### Examples

* _<b>dy</b> moal_ “slowly”
* _<b>dy</b> barriaghtagh_ “triumphantly”
* _<b>dy</b> mennick_ “often”

### <a name="Comp">`Comp`</a>: comparative

The comparative particle introduces a comparative adjective.
This is historically a nominal, but is tagged as a particle
for consistency with Irish.

#### Examples

* _<b>ny</b> syrjey_ “higher”
* _<b>ny</b> smoo_ “bigger”

### <a name="Cmpl">`Cmpl`</a>: complementizer

These complementizers are used to introduce a clausal complement.

#### Examples

* _Strooys <b>dy</b> row aggle orroo_ “I think <b>that</b> they were afraid”
* _Dooyrt eh <b>nagh</b> row fys echey_ “He said <b>that</b> he didn't know”

### <a name="Inf">`Inf`</a>: infinitive

The particle _<b>y</b>_ is used with a verbal noun to form the infinitive in Manx. The verb form is usually lenited.

#### Examples

* _goo mie <b>y</b> chlashtyn_ “to hear a good report”
* _shen <b>y</b> yannoo_ “to do that”

### <a name="Vb">`Vb`</a>: verbal

Verbal particles include the negative particle _<b>cha</b>_ and the negative
relativizer _<b>nagh</b>_ (the positive relativizer is usually omitted
in Manx, unlike Irish).

#### Examples

* _<b>Cha</b> nel mee_ “I am not”
* _clagh <b>nagh</b> dtrog oo_ “a stone you will not lift”

### <a name="Voc">`Voc`</a>: vocative

The vocative particle is _<b>y</b>_, and is sometimes used to directly
address someone.

#### Examples

* _Nellie, <b>y</b> chree_ “Dearest Nellie”
