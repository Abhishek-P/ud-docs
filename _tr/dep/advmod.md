An adverbial modifier of a word is a (non-clausal) [adverb](tr-pos/ADV)
or adverbial phrase that serves to modify the meaning of the word.

Note that nouns in particular morphological [cases](tr-feat/Case),
or followed by an [adposition](tr-pos/ADP) are marked
using [obl]() even if they function as adverbial modifiers.

We use a special label, [tr-dep/advmod:emph]() for adverbial modifiers that are used for emphasis.

## Negation

In UD v1, there was a special relation `neg`. In UD v2, `advmod` is used in its place.
The negation modifier is the relation between a negation word and the word it modifies.

In Turkish, negation is typically done through suffixation.
We use `advmod` only if the non-predicative use of  the word _değil_.
