Degree of comparison is typically an inflectional feature of some [adjectives](u-pos/ADJ) and [adverbs](u-pos/ADV).

In Turkish, degree of an adjective or adverb is modified through adverbs _en_ "(the) most" and _daha_ "more".
We only annotate these two adverbs with the `Degree` feature.


### <a name="Cmp">`Cmp`</a>: comparative, second degree

The quality of one object is compared to the same quality of another object.

#### Examples

* _daha güzel_  "prettier"
* _daha çabuk_  "quicker/faster"

### <a name="Sup">`Sup`</a>: superlative, third degree

The quality of one object is compared to the same quality of all other objects within a set.

#### Examples

* _en güzel_  "prettiest"
* _en çabuk_  "quickest/fastest"
