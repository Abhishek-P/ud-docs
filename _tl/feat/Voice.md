Voice is typically a feature of [verbs](u-pos/VERB).
It may also occur with other parts of speech
([nouns](u-pos/NOUN), [adjectives](u-pos/ADJ), [adverbs](u-pos/ADV)),
depending on whether borderline word forms such as gerunds and participles
are classified as verbs or as the other category.

For Indo-European speakers, voice means mainly the active-passive
distinction. In other languages, other shades of verb meaning are
categorized as voice.

### <a name="Act">`Act`</a>: active or actor-focus voice

The subject of the verb is the doer of the action (agent), the object
is affected by the action (patient). This label is also used for the
actor-focus voice of Austronesian languages. <!-- which is labeled AGFOC in UniMorph -->

### <a name="Pass">`Pass`</a>: passive or patient-focus voice
