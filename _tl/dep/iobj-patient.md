A _ng_-marked nominal that denotes the patient in a clause with a voice other than actor-focus
or patient-focus. There are two objects (the other one denotes the agent). Only one of them
can use the `obj` relation; we reserve it for the agent and subtype it [obj:agent]().
The patient is thus a subtype of `iobj`.
