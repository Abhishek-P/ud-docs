In an analogy to [nsubj:pass](), `nsubj:ifoc` signals that the mapping between syntactic functions
and semantic roles is non-standard. Specifically, the verb is in the instrumental-focused [Voice](),
hence the subject specifies an instrument rather than the agent.

“John wrote Mary a letter on the typewriter.”
