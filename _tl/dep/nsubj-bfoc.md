In an analogy to [nsubj:pass](), `nsubj:bfoc` signals that the mapping between syntactic functions
and semantic roles is non-standard. Specifically, the verb is in the beneficiary-focused [Voice](),
hence the subject specifies a beneficiary rather than the agent.

~~~ sdparse

nsubj:bfoc(Ipagaalis, bata)
nsubj:bfoc(BP-FUT-take.out, child)
~~~

“A/the woman will take some rice out of a/the sack for the child.”
