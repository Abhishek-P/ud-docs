In an analogy to [nsubj:pass](), `nsubj:lfoc` signals that the mapping between syntactic functions
and semantic roles is non-standard. Specifically, the verb is in the location-focused [Voice](),
hence the subject specifies a location or goal rather than the agent.

~~~ sdparse

nsubj:lfoc(Binigyan, istudyante)
nsubj:lfoc(Given, student)
~~~

“The teacher gave the student a prize.”
