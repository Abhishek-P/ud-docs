# UD for Gujarati <span class="flagspan"><img class="flag" src="../../flags/svg/IN.svg" /></span>

Gujarati is an Indo-Aryan language originating from the western Indian state of Gujarat. The language is widely spoken by over 56 million speakers and is one of the 22 languages with official status in India. Yet, the Gujarati Computational Linguistics community is still in its infancy. Earlier literature classifies Gujarati in the "Scraping-Bys" category (category 1) in their taxonomy indicating a scant availability of labeled datasets.
