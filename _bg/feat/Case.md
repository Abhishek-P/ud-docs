Bulgarian nouns have lost case inflection except for the occasional _vocative (v)_.
The cases are still alive in personal pronouns: _nominative (n)_, _accusative (a)_ and _dative (d)_.

Accusative and dative cases are still present in the masculine, singular forms of some other pronouns – _interrogative, indefinite, collective, relative, negative_. Please note that the long dative forms are analytical and thus, only the accusative form is marked after the preposition ‘на’.

### <a name="Voc">`Voc`</a>: vocative

In Bulgarian only some nouns have special vocative forms (v):

#### Examples

- Иване, приятелю, Родино, Стефке / _Ivane, priyatelyu, Rodino, Stefke_ (Ivan, friend, homeland, Stefka)

### <a name="Nom">`Nom`</a>: nominative

#### Examples

* _тя_ / _tja_ "she.NOM"

### <a name="Dat">`Dat`</a>: dative

#### Examples

* _му_ / _mu_ "him.DAT.SHORT"

In our tagset another idiosyncratic case has been marked – the so-called ‘dative possessive case’ (s). It refers to situations where the short possessive pronoun comes before its possessor noun and thus – next to the verb.

* _Той ми взе шапката_ / _Toj mi vze šapkata_ "He my.POSS took hat.DEF" (He took my hat.)

The canonical sentence would be: _Той взе шапката ми_ / _Toj vze šapkata mi_ "He took hat.DEF my.POSS" (He took my hat).

### <a name="Acc">`Acc`</a>: accusative

#### Examples

* _нея, го_ / _neja, go_ "her.ACC.LONG, him.ACC.SHORT"
* _кого, някого, никого_ / _kogo, njakogo, nikogo_ "whom, someone.ACC, nobody.ACC"
* _на кого, на някого, на никого_ / _na kogo, na njakogo, na nikogo_ "to whom, to someone.ACC, to nobody.ACC"
