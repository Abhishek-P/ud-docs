The [fixed]() relation is one of the three relations for multiword expressions (MWEs) (the other two being [flat]() and [compound]()). It is used for certain fixed grammaticized expressions that behave like function words or short adverbials.

In Bulgarian this relation applies to fixed complex conjunctions (like _за да_ za da "in order to"), prepositions (_в интерес на_ in interest of "in someone's interest"), adverbs (_може би_ mozhe bi "maybe"). It also applies to the reflexive structures of a long and short pronouns _себе си_ sebe si "oneself".
