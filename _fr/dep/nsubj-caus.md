The `nsubj:caus` relation links the infinitive verb (i.e. the head of the sentence) to the syntactical subject of the sentence (i.e. the causer) in a causative construction.
The infinitive verb governs the causative verb with an [aux:caus]() relation.
The true agent of the action described by the sentence is annotated with an [iobj:agent](), an [obj:agent]() or an [obl:agent]() relation.
