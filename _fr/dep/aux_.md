An auxiliary of a clause is a [non-main verb](u-pos/AUX) of the clause.

All French corpora uses 3 auxiliaries: _être_, _avoir_ and _faire_.
Only **UD_French-ParTUT** uses a few other modal verbs as auxiliaries: _pouvoir_, _vouloir_, _aller_.

The dependency `aux` is used in **UD_French-Spoken** and in **UD_French-FTB** for tense auxiliaries only.
**UD_French-ParTUT** uses the dependency `aux` for tense and for modal verbs.
Tense auxiliaries are annotated with the [aux:tense]() relations in the four other French treebanks.

For the passive [voice](u-feat/Voice), the relation is not labeled `aux` but [aux:pass]().
For the causative auxiliary _faire_, the relation is [aux:caus]().

In French, both _être_ and _avoir_ can be used as tense auxiliaries.
