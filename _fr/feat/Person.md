`Person` is marked for verbs and pronouns in French, as first (`1`), second (`2`), or third (`3`) person.

### <a name="1">`1`</a>: first person

In singular, the first person refers just to the speaker / author. In
plural, it must include the speaker and one or more additional
persons. Some languages (e.g. Taiwanese) distinguish inclusive and
exclusive 1<SUP>st</SUP> person plural pronouns: the former include
the addressee of the utterance (i.e. _I + you_), the latter exclude
them (i.e. _I + they_).

#### Examples

* _<b>je</b>_, _<b>nous</b>_
* _<b>je fais</b>_ "<b>I</b> do"
* _<b>nous faisons</b>_ "<b>we</b> do"

### <a name="2">`2`</a>: second person

In singular, the second person refers to the addressee of the
utterance / text. In plural, it may mean several addressees and
optionally some third persons too.

#### Examples

* _<b>tu</b>, <b>vous</b>_
* _<b>tu fais</b>_ "<b>you</b> do"
* _<b>vous faites</b>_ "<b>you</b> do"

### <a name="3">`3`</a>: third person

The third person refers to one or more persons that are neither
speakers nor addressees.

#### Examples

* _<b>il</b>_, _<b>elle</b>_, _<b>ils</b>_, _<b>elles</b>_
* _<b>il fait</b>_ "<b>he does</b>"
* _<b>elles font</b>_ "<b>they</b> do"
