### Definition
An auxiliary verb is a verb that accompanies the lexical verb of a verb phrase and expresses grammatical distinctions not carried by the lexical verb, such as person, number, tense, mood, aspect, and voice.

French auxiliary verbs can be divided into tense, passive and causative auxiliaries

### Delimitation

At the opposite of the original Google annotation and the universal UD guidelines, French corpora don't use modal auxiliaries.
Verbs likes _savoir_, _pouvoir_, _devoir_, _vouloir_, _falloir_, _voir_, _aimer_, _souhaiter_ are considered as normal verbs.

French corpora has just three auxiliary verb ([AUX]())

	* *être* (to be) is used as a copule, as a tense auxiliary and as a passive auxiliary,
	* *avoir* (to have) is used as a tense auxiliary,
	* *faire* (to make) is used in causative constructions.
