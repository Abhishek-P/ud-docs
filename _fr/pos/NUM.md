### Definition

A numeral is a word, functioning most typically as a determiner, a pronoun or an adjective, that expresses a number and a relation to the number, such as quantity, sequence, frequency or fraction.

Cardinal numerals are covered by `NUM` regardless of syntactic function and regardless of whether they are expressed as words (_quatre_ "four"), digits (4) or Roman numerals (IV). By contrast, ordinal numerals are always tagged `ADJ`.
