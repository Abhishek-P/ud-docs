The verb _bod_ is the verb for copula use and for composed tenses. Composed tenses however do not use participles but TAM markers (historically prepositions or adjectives)

In contrast to other verbs _bod_ has 6 tenses. In the present tense it has a special form _sy(dd)_ for relative clauses.
_Bod_ is used 
* as a copula (together with a predicative particle _yn_): _**Mae** o'n frenin_ "he is king", _**roedd** hi'n goch_ "it was read"
* composed tenses:
  * _**Mae** Ioan yn canu_ "Ioan is singing"
  * _**Mae** Ioan wedi canu_ "Ioan was singing"
  * _**Mae** Ioan wedi **bod** yn canu_ "Ioan has been singing"
