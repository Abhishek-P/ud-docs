#### Description

A proper noun is a noun that is the name of a specific individual, place, object or organisation. In Irish, proper nouns always have initial capitalisation. 

Welsh placenames are mutated if the context requires it, foreign placenames are sometimes mutated. Person names are only rarely mutated.

#### Examples

_i Fangor a Chaergybi_ "to Bangor and Holyhead"
