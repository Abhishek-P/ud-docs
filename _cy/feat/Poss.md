In Welsh, `Poss` is a Boolean feature of [pronouns](en-pos/PRON). It tells whether the pronoun is possessive.
Welsh has no possessive pronouns, but uses the so-called dependent pronouns as possessive pronouns.
Dependent pronouns without this feature, are not possessives (but pronominal direct oobject of verbnouns)
The possessive pronoun can be reduplicated after the possessed noun, using a different form.


### <a name="Yes">`Yes`</a>: it is possesive

#### Examples

* _eich tŷ_ "your (plur) house"
* _eich tŷ chi_ "your (plur) house"

Note that there is no `No` value. If the word is not possessive, the `Poss` feature will just not be mentioned in the `FEAT` column.
