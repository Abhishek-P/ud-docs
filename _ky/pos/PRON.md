### Definition

Pronouns are words that substitute for nouns or noun phrases, whose
meaning is recoverable from the linguistic or extralinguistic context.

In Kyrgyz some pronouns also function as determiners (e.g., _Бул_"this"),
these words are always marked according to their usage (`PRON` or
`DET`).

### Examples
	
- personal pronouns: _мен, сен, сиз(formal), ал, биз, силер, сиздер(formal), алар_
  "I, you, he/she/it, we, you (plural), they"
- reflexive pronoun: _өзү_ "oneself"
- demonstrative pronouns: _Бул_
- interrogative pronouns: _ким, эмне_ "who, what"
