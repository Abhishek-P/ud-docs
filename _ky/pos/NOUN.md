### Definition

Nouns are a part of speech typically denoting a person, place, thing,
animal or idea.

The `NOUN` tag is intended for common nouns only. See [PROPN]() for
proper nouns and [PRON]() for pronouns.

Kyrgyz nouns inflect for [ky-feat/Number](), [possessor](ky-feat/Person-psor) and [ky-feat/Case]().


All adjectives and some of the adverbs may function as a noun without additional derivation, in this cases, we keep the POS tag of the original word, but assign nominal features to the word.


### Examples

- _кошуна_ "neighbour"
- _балык_ "fish"
- _аймак_ "region"
