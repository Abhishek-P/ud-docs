### Definition

Determiners are words that modify nouns or noun phrases and express
the reference of the noun phrase in context. That is, a determiner may
indicate whether the noun is referring to a definite or indefinite
element of a class, to a closer or more distant element, to an element
belonging to a specified person or thing, to a particular number or
quantity, etc.


Kyrgyz does not have a definite article.
We mark it as `DET` in this usage.

### Examples

- demonstrative determiners: _Бул_ "this", _ушул_ "this/that"
- interrogative determiners: _кайсы_ "which"
