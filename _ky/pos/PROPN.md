### Definition

A proper noun is a noun (or nominal content word) that is the name (or
part of the name) of a specific individual, place, or object.

Note that `PROPN` is only used for the subclass of nouns that are used
as names and that often exhibit special syntactic properties.
When other phrases or sentences are used as names, 
the component words retain their original tags.

Acronyms of proper nouns, such as _NATO_ and _ГЭС_, should be tagged `PROPN`.

### Examples

- _Кытай_, _Кыргызстан_, _Бишкек_
- _Нуржигит_, _Айжамал_
- _NATO_, _ККМ_ , _ГЭС_
