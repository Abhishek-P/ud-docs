Kyrgyz has a complex tense/aspect/modality system.

Kyrgyz verbs can indicate actions in the present, past or future.
Complex tenses for actions that happened before, during, or after a past event can also be specified by suffixation.
The actions that happen before, during, or after a future event are expressed using an auxiliary.

The verbs expressing actions that happened before a reference in the past are marked with value `Pqp`.
For events that happen during the past reference, we use `Tense=Past` with proper progressive (`Prog`) or habitual (`Hab`) [Aspect]().

### <a name="Past">`Past`</a>: past tense

Kyrgyz past tense is realized with *-ты* or *-ген* or  *эле* suffixes on verbal predicates.
The difference between the *-ты* and *-ген* forms are related to evidentiality ([Evident]()) rather than `Tense`. Both morphemes refer to a (completed) past event.

These suffixes also combine with others to refer to time relative to a past event, which will be discussed below.

#### Examples

* *үйүнө кетти* 'she went home'
* *үйүнө кеткен* 'she went home' (evidential: speaker does not have direct information on the event)
* *ал үйгө кетиши керек эле* 'she should have gone home'
* *эгер ал үйүнө кетсе эле* 'if she went home'
* *ал ооруп калды* 'she was sick'
* *ал ооруп калган 'she was sick' (evidential)

### <a name="Fut">`Fut`</a>: future tense

Kyrgyz future tense is expressed with same present tense .
Copular predicates cannot directly take future `Tense` morphemes.


#### Examples

* *үйгө кетет* 'she will go home' 


### <a name="Pres">`Pres`</a>: present  tense

The present tense in Kyrgyz is realized by lack of past or future morphemes. If the action continues, the *жатат* suffix is used.

#### Examples

* *үйгө бара жатат.* 'she is going home'
* *үйгө кетиши керек* 'she should go home'
* *үйгө кетет* 'she goes home'

The differences between these forms are [Aspect]() and [Mood]() differences.
