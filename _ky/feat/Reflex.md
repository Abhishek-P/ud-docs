It tells whether the word is reflexive, i.e. refers to the subject of its clause.

This marks the reflexive pronoun _өзү_ and its inflected forms.

### <a name="Yes">`Yes`</a>: it is reflexive

Note that there is no `No` value. If the word is not reflexive, the
`Reflex` feature will just not be mentioned in the `FEAT`
column. (Which means that empty value has the `No` meaning.)

#### Examples

* _өзүм_ "self"
* _өзү_ "himself/herself/itself"
* _өзүмүз_ "ourselves"
