In Kyrgyz, `Person` is a feature of personal [pronouns](ky-pos/PRON), and [verbs](ky-pos/VERB).
`Person` marking on verbs are obligatory in Kyrgyz for all finite verb forms.
The `Person` marker on predicates indicate the subject when there is
no over subject.

### <a name="1">`1`</a>: first person

In singular, the first person refers just to the speaker / author. In
plural, it must include the speaker and one or more additional
persons.

It is used for pronouns *Мен* 'I' and *биз* 'we' and their inflected forms, and verbs with a first person  plural/singular agreement suffix.

#### Examples

* *<b>Мен</b>* 'I'
* *мен<b>и менен</b>* 'with me'
* *<b>мен<b>ики</b>* 'the one that belongs to us'
* *(мен) окуду<b>м</b>* 'I read-PAST' -- note the optionality of the subject
* *(биз) окуй<b>буз</b>* 'We read-FUT'


### <a name="2">`2`</a>: second person

In singular, the second person refers to the addressee of the
utterance / text. In plural, it may mean several addressees and
optionally some third persons too.

It is used for pronouns *сен* 'you-SING' and *сиз* 'you-PLU' (informal), *силер* 'you-PLU' (formal) and their inflected forms, and verbs with a second person  plural/singular agreement suffix.

The second person singular agreement suffix is null for verbs in imperative form.

#### Examples

* *<b>сен</b>и* 'you(SG)-ACC'
* *<b>сиз<b>и менен</b>* 'with you(PL)'
* *<b>сиз да* 'you(PL)-LOC - on/at you(PL)'
* *оку!* 'read!'
* *(сен) окуду<b>н</b>* 'you(SG) read-PAST'
* *(сиз) окуй<b>суз</b>* 'you(PL) read-FUT'


### <a name="3">`3`</a>: third person

The third person refers to one or more persons that are neither
speakers nor addressees.

It is used for pronouns *ал* 'he/she/it' and *алар* 'they' and their inflected forms, and verbs with a second third plural/singular agreement suffix. The third person singular agreement suffix is null in most cases.

#### Examples

* *ага* 'he/she/it-DAT'
* *алар <b>менен</b>* 'with them'
* *(ал) окуду* 'he/she read-PAST'
* *(алар) оку<b>ш</b>ту* 'they read-PAST' -- note the optionality of the  agreement on the verb
