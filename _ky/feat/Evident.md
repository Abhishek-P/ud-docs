`Evident`iality is a feature of [verbs](ky-pos/VERB).
It indicates the source of evidence for a given statement.
It is often classified as a mood,
but some linguists considers it an additional dimension alongside [Tense]()/[Aspect]()/[Moodality](Mood).


### <a name="Fh">`Fh`</a>: first hand

This is the default.
The speaker has first-hand evidence for the statement/event.

#### Examples
(cf. the same examples below for `Nfh`)

* _үйгө бара жатат_ 'she/he is going home'
* _үйгө кетиши керек_ 'she/he has to go home'
