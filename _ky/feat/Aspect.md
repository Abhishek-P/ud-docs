Aspect is a feature that specifies duration of the action in time, whether the action has been completed, ongoing etc.

In Kyrgyz a set of verbal morphemes alter the `Aspect` feature of a verb.
These morphemes often affect the [Tense]() and [Mood]() features as well.
The mapping between the suffixes and the `Aspect` values may sometimes be non-trivial.

The following describes the values used for `Aspect` together with the
suffixes typically introduce the defined `Aspect` value.
See [ky-overview/special-syntax]() for the discussion of mapping
relevant verbal suffixes to `Tense`, `Aspect` and `Mood` values.

### <a name="Perf">`Perf`</a>: perfect aspect

The action has been / will have been completed.

#### Examples

* *үйгө кетти* 'she went home'
* *үйгө кетти окшойт* 'she apparently went home'
* *үйгө барат* 'she will go home'
* *ал үйүнө кеткен болчу* 'she had gone home (when I arrived)'

### <a name="Prog">`Prog`</a>: progressive aspect

### <a name="Hab">`Hab`</a>: habitual aspect
