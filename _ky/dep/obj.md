The direct object of a verb is the noun phrase that denotes the entity
acted upon.

In Kyrgyz, direct objects typically take
either nominative (unmarked), or accusative [cases](ky-feat/Case).
An object can also be in ablative case if only part of it is 
affected by the predeicate (see below for an example).
We do not mark arguments of verbs in other cases with ``obj``,
the [obl]() relation is used for any "non-core" arguments and adjuncts.
