`acl` stands for finite and non-finite clauses that modify a nominal. 
The head of the `acl` relation is the noun that is modified, 
and the dependent is the head of the clause that modifies the noun.


The primary means of subordination, including forming adjectival clauses,
is through the subordinating suffixes attached to the head of the subordinate clause.
