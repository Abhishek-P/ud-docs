A marker is the subordinating conjunction introducing a finite clause subordinate to another clause.
The mark is a dependent of the subordinate clause head.

Most subordinate clauses in Kyrgyz are introduced by morphological means.
However, there are also a few words that introduce subordinate clauses,
and should be indicated by `mark` relation.
