Degree is relevant for adjectives and some adverbs in Hungarian.

### <a name="Pos">`Pos`</a>: positive

This is the base form that merely states a quality of something,
without comparing it to qualities of others. Note that although this
degree is traditionally called "positive", negative properties can be
compared, too.

#### Examples

* [hu] _<b>nagy</b>_ “big”
* [hu] _<b>jól</b>_ “well”

### <a name="Cmp">`Cmp`</a>: comparative

The quality of one object is compared to the same quality of another
object.

#### Examples

* [hu] _<b>nagyobb</b>_ “bigger”
* [hu] _<b>jobban</b>_ “better” (adverb)

### <a name="Sup">`Sup`</a>: superlative

The quality of one object is compared to the same quality of all other
objects within a set.

#### Examples

* [hu] _<b>legnagyobb</b>_ “biggest”
* [hu] _<b>legjobban</b>_ “best” (adverb)
