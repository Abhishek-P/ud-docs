We use Voice for verbs and auxiliaries with two values, Act and Cau.

### <a name="Act">`Act`</a>: active voice

The subject of the verb is the doer of the action (agent), the object
is affected by the action (patient).

#### Examples

* [hu] _<b>mos</b>_ “wash”

### <a name="Cau">`Cau`</a>: causative voice

Causative forms of verbs are classified as a voice category because,
when compared to the basic active form, they change the number of
participants and their mapping on semantic roles.
(See, e.g., the [documentation](https://wiki.ufal.ms.mff.cuni.cz/_media/user:zeman:treebanks:ttbankkl.pdf)
of the METU Sabanci treebank (page 26).)

#### Examples

* [hu] _<b>mosat</b>_ “make somebody wash”
