The `Person` feature for Basque follows the standard UD guidelines for nouns, adjectives,
determiners and adverbs. However, finite verbs contain agreement features on person for the
subject, object and indirect object, so the Basque treebank follows the UD description for
[layered features](/u/overview/feat-layers.html), defining
[Person[erg]=1,2,3](/u/feat/Person-erg.html),
[Person[abs]=1,2,3](/u/feat/Person-abs.html), and
[Person[dat]=1,2,3](/u/feat/Person-dat.html).

### <a name="1">`1`</a>: first person

In singular, the first person refers just to the speaker / author. In
plural, it must include the speaker and one or more additional
persons.

### <a name="2">`2`</a>: second person

In singular, the second person refers to the addressee of the
utterance / text. In plural, it may mean several addressees and
optionally some third persons too.

#### Examples

* [eu] _<b>zu</b>, <b>hi</b>_ "you"

### <a name="3">`3`</a>: third person

The third person refers to one or more persons that are neither
speakers nor addressees.
