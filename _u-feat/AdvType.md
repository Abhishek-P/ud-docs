Semantic subclasses of adverbs. They are annotated in some tagsets
(e.g. Bulgarian, Czech, Hindi, Japanese) and would probably apply to
many other languages if their tagsets cared to cover them. Note that
the "prontype" feature also applies to some adverbs and is orthogonal
to "AdvType".

### <a name="Man">`Man`</a>: adverb of manner

#### Examples

* [en] _<b>how, so</b>_

### <a name="Loc">`Loc`</a>: adverb of location

#### Examples

* [en] _<b>where, here, there</b>_
* [cs] _<b>kde</b>_ “where”, _<b>odkud</b>_ “from where”, _<b>kudy</b>_ “through where”, _<b>kam</b>_ “where to”

### <a name="Tim">`Tim`</a>: adverb of time

#### Examples

* [en] _<b>when, now, then</b>_
* [cs] _<b>kdy</b>_ “when”, _<b>odkdy</b>_ “since when”, _<b>dokdy</b>_ “till when”

### <a name="Deg">`Deg`</a>: adverb of quantity or degree

Note that there is a fuzzy borderline between adverbs of degree and
indefinite numerals (as they are called in some grammars).

#### Examples

* [cs] _<b>více, méně</b>_ “more, less”

### <a name="Cau">`Cau`</a>: adverb of cause

#### Examples

* [en] _<b>why</b>_

### <a name="Mod">`Mod`</a>: adverb of modal nature

The Czech examples below are similar to modal verbs: they take
infinitives as arguments and add the meaning of possibility, necessity
or recommendedness. I suspect that the Bulgarian example
(transliteration of French "à propos") is used differently but its
native tagset also calles it "modal".

#### Examples

* [bg] _<b>апропо</b>_
* [cs] _<b>možno</b>_ “possible”, _<b>nutno</b>_ “necessary”, _<b>radno</b>_ “adviseable”, _<b>třeba</b>_ “necessary”
