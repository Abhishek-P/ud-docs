Boolean feature, typically of [pronouns](u-pos/PRON) or
[determiners](u-pos/DET). It tells whether the word is reflexive,
i.e. refers to the subject of its clause.

While many tagsets would have "reflexive" as one of the various
pronoun types, this feature is intentionally separate from
[PronType]().
When used with pronouns and determiners, it should be combined
with `PronType=Prs`, regardless whether they really distinguish
the [Person]() feature (in some languages they do, in others they
do not).

Note that forms that are canonically reflexive sometimes have other functions in the
language, too. The feature `Reflex=Yes` denotes the word type, not its actual function
in context (which can be distinguished by dependency relation types). Hence the feature
is not restricted to situations where the word is used truly reflexively.

For example, reflexive clitics in European languages often have a wide array of possible
functions (middle, [passive](/u/dep/expl-pass.html), inchoative,
[impersonal](/u/dep/expl-impers.html), or even as a [lexical morpheme](/u/dep/expl-pv.html)).
Besides that, reflexives in some languages are also used for emphasis (while other languages
have separate emphatic pronouns), and in some languages they signal reciprocity (while other
languages have separate reciprocal pronouns).
Using `Reflex=Yes` with all of them has the benefit that they can be easily identified
(however, if it is possible for the annotators to distinguish contexts where a reflexive
pronoun is used reciprocally or emphatically, it is possible to combine `Reflex=Yes` with
`PronType=Rcp` or `PronType=Emp`, instead of `PronType=Prs`).

Note that while some languages also have reflexive verbs, these are in
fact fused verbs with reflexive pronouns, as in Spanish _despertarse_
or Russian _проснуться_ (both meaning “to wake up”). Thus in these
cases the fused token will be split to two syntactic words, one of
them being a reflexive pronoun. In languages where the reflexive pronoun
is not split, it may be more appropriate to mark the verb as the middle [Voice]()
than using `Reflex=Yes` with the verb.

### <a name="Yes">`Yes`</a>: it is reflexive

Note that there is no `No` value. If the word is not reflexive, the
`Reflex` feature will just not be mentioned in the `FEAT`
column. (Which means that empty value has the `No` meaning.)

#### Examples

* [cs] reflexive personal pronouns: _se, si_; reflexive possessive
  pronoun: _svůj_
