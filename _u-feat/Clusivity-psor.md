Clusivity is a feature of first-person plural personal [pronouns](u-pos/PRON).
Clusivity[psor] is possessor's clusivity, marked e.g. on [nouns](u-pos/NOUN) in Mbyá Guaraní.
These noun forms would be translated to English as possessive pronoun + noun.

This layered feature is conveniently used for possessive inflections
of nouns, although nouns normally do not have a `Clusivity` feature,
meaning that no other layers are needed. Nevertheless, the possessive
morphology typically also includes `Number`, which could be confused
with the number of the noun, and we thus have `Person[psor]` together with `Number[psor]`.

This layered feature is normally not used with possessive pronouns.
They traditionally have just simple `Clusivity`.
(And in some languages, possessive pronouns are actually identical to
personal pronouns in the genitive case.)

### <a name="In">`In`</a>: inclusive possessor

Includes the listener, i.e. _we_ = _I + you_ (+ optionally _they_).

#### Examples

* [gun] _<b>ñandejaryi</b>_ “our (my+your) grandmother” (lit. B1.PL.INCL-grandmother)

### <a name="Ex">`Ex`</a>: exclusive possessor

Excludes the listener, i.e. _we_ = _I + they._

#### Examples

* [gun] _<b>orejaryi</b>_ “our (my+their) grandmother” (lit. B1.PL.EXCL-grandmother)
