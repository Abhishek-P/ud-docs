Low-value (<5) cardinal numbers in Slavic languages behave
morphologically and syntactically differently from the rest, therefore
some tagsets distinguish them (so far seen in Czech, Polish, and also
Arabic, although it is not Slavic).

In Czech, number "one" agrees with the counted noun in gender, number
and case. Number "two" agrees in gender and case and numbers "three"
and "four" agree in case. These numerals behave similarly to
adjectives. Numbers "five", "six" etc. behave differently. If the case
of the counted phrase is genitive, dative, locative or instrumental,
the numeral agrees in case with the noun. However, if the case of the
whole phrase is nominative, accusative or vocative, then the numeral
dictates that the noun is in genitive. This behavior is similar to
nouns modified by other nouns in genitive. (Note that this is why in
the Czech PDT some numeral nodes are annotated as governing nouns
instead of modifying them.)

### <a name="1">`1`</a>: numeric value 1

#### Examples

* [cs] _<b>jeden, jedna, jedno</b>_ "one"

### <a name="2">`2`</a>: numeric value 2

#### Examples

* [cs] _<b>dva, dvě</b>_ "two"

### <a name="3">`3`</a>: numeric value 3 or 4

#### Examples

* [cs] _<b>tři</b>_ "three"
* [cs] _<b>čtyři</b>_ "four"
