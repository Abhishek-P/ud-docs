Degree of comparison is typically an inflectional feature of some
[adjectives](u-pos/ADJ) and [adverbs](u-pos/ADV). A different flavor of degree
is diminutives and augmentatives, which often apply to [nouns](u-pos/NOUN)
but are not restricted to them.

### <a name="Pos">`Pos`</a>: positive, first degree

This is the base form that merely states a quality of something,
without comparing it to qualities of others. Note that although this
degree is traditionally called "positive", negative properties can be
compared, too.

#### Examples

* [en] _<b>young</b> man_
* [cs] _<b>mladý</b> muž_

### <a name="Equ">`Equ`</a>: equative

The quality of one object is compared to the same quality of another
object, and the result is that they are identical or similar (“as X as”).
Note that it marks the adjective and it is distinct from the equative [Case](),
which marks the standard of comparison.

#### Examples

* [et] _<b>pikkune</b> (pikkus+ne)_ “as tall as”

### <a name="Cmp">`Cmp`</a>: comparative, second degree

The quality of one object is compared to the same quality of another
object.

#### Examples

* [en] _the man is <b>younger</b> than me_
* [cs] _ten muž je <b>mladší</b> než já_

### <a name="Sup">`Sup`</a>: superlative, third degree

The quality of one object is compared to the same quality of all other
objects within a set.

#### Examples

* [en] _this is the <b>youngest</b> man in our team_
* [cs] _toto je <b>nejmladší</b> muž v našem týmu_

### <a name="Abs">`Abs`</a>: absolute superlative

Some languages can express morphologically that the studied quality of
the given object is so strong that there is hardly any other object
exceeding it. The quality is not actually compared to any particular
set of objects.

#### Examples

* [es] _guapo_ "handsome"; _<b>guapísimo</b>_ "<b>indescribably
  handsome</b>"

### <a name="Dim">`Dim`</a>: diminutive

Morphologically derived form of a noun that indicates small size, or,
metaphorically, affection towards the entity described by the noun.
While nouns are the prototypical category in which diminutives are
formed, the feature is not restricted to nouns and in some languages
similar morphology can be observed with other categories (adjectives,
verbs).

#### Examples

* [cs] _člověk_ "man"; _<b>človíček</b>_ "<b>little man</b>"
* [nl] _appel_ "apple"; _<b>appeltje</b>_ "<b>little apple</b>"

### <a name="Aug">`Aug`</a>: augmentative

Morphologically derived form of a noun that indicates large size or
force. While nouns are the prototypical category in which augmentatives
are formed, the feature is not restricted to nouns and in some languages
similar morphology can be observed with other categories (adjectives,
verbs).

#### Examples

* [cs] _chlap_ "guy"; _<b>chlapák</b>_ "<b>big guy, macho</b>"
* [pt] _apartamento_ "apartment"; _<b>apartamentão</b>_ "<b>big apartment</b>"
