A nominal modifier. This is the label given to prepositional objects and other types of nominal dependents which are non-core arguments and not verbal modifiers (i.e. neither subject nor object nor oblique). Note that in keeping with Universal Dependencies for other languages, the `nmod` noun attaches directly to the lexeme it modifies (usually a noun), while the preposition is seen as a `case` dependent of the modifying noun.

Note that prepositional arguments of verbs are marked as `obl`, not `nmod`, including prepositional objects of verbs of perception:
