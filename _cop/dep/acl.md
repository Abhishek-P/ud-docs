Head of an adjectival or verbal clause, usually marking the verb or nominal predicate in that clause, when the clause is **not** marked by a relative converter (in which case see `acl:relcl`). The arrow points from the modified element (usually a noun) to the predicate of the verbal clause, usually an infinitve.

Example:

~~~ sdparse
ϩⲉⲛ ⲁⲡⲟⲧ ⲉ ϩⲟⲣⲡ ⲟⲩ \n some cups to wet them
acl(ⲁⲡⲟⲧ, ϩⲟⲣⲡ)
~~~
