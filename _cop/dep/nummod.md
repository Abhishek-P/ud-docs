This label is used for number modifiers, counting the modified nouns. Note that for numbers taking a preposition ⲛ, the preposition is attached via the case label to the counted noun, but the article (and any further prepositions preceding the article) are attached to the nominal head as well, as shown below.

For the number ⲥⲛⲁⲩ ‘two’, which follows the counted noun, the noun is still the head, i.e. the dependency arrow points forward from the noun to the number.

For annotating complex numbers, the right-most part of the number is the head of the other number parts with the label `compound`, and the case marker 'ⲛ' is attached to each part individually.
