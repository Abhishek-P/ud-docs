This label is used to link two main clauses that are listed together as one sentence (either by accident, or because they are not quite independent sentences). It is also used for parenthetical clauses in the middle of other clauses. The dependency goes from the root of the first clause, or in parenthetical cases, the non-parenthetical clause, to the other one:

If both of these clauses are seen as one sentence, there is no other relation to call the connection between the first clause and the second one. Note that this is distinct from two coordinated clauses, e.g. with ⲁⲩⲱ ‘and’, for which `cc` and `conj` should be used.

For more than two clauses, parataxis forms a chain rather than a 'fountain', i.e. unlike `conj` it does not attach all clauses to the first one:

~~~ sdparse

If multiple clauses are listed, but one of them (usually the last) is explicitly coordinated with a conjunction such as ⲁⲩⲱ ‘and’, the entire structure is analyzed as a fountain of `conj` relations emanating from the first clause, similarly to English ‘A, B and C’:
