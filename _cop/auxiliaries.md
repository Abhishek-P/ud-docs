# Coptic Auxiliaries

The standard Coptic grammar posits many auxiliaries. The basic form of most Coptic predications is: [AUX]() + `subj` + [VERB](). Where `AUX` determines tense, aspect, modality and polarity, and the verb is just an uninflected infinitive. The auxiliary forms are listed in the documentation for the XPOS tagset [here](https://github.com/CopticScriptorium/tagger-part-of-speech/blob/master/scriptorium_tagset_documentation.pdf).

See also the documentation of the [aux]() relation.

* _ⲟⲩⲛ_ – indefinite present marker
* _ⲙⲛ_ – negative indefinite present marker
* _ⲙⲛⲧⲉ_ – pronominal form of _ⲙⲛ_
* _ϣⲁⲣⲉ_ – aorist aspect (it is generally the case that…), form for nominal
subject
* _ϣⲁ_ – aorist, form for pronominal subject
* _ⲙⲉⲣⲉ_ – negative aorist (it is generally not the case), form for noun subject
* _ⲙⲉ_ – negative aorist, form for pronoun subject

* _ⲛⲉⲣⲉ_ – imperfect (for noun subject)
* _ⲛⲉ_ – imperfect (for pronoun subject)
* _ⲛⲁ_ – future tense
* _ⲛⲧⲉ_ – ‘conjunctive’ (marks that a verb has identical tense aspect to its
subordinating verb, whatever that is)

else happens)

* _ⲉⲣϣⲁⲛ_ – conditional mood
* _ⲉϣ, ϣ_ – potential mood (can…)
* _ⲛⲉϣ_ – rare negated form of _ⲉϣ_ “not be able to” – we’d like to not split the
negation, since this negation is archaic (does not appear by itself for this
form) and the negative form will appear separately in dictionaries as its own
