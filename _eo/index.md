# UD for Esperanto <span class="flagspan"><img class="flag" src="../../flags/svg/ESPERANTO.svg" /></span>
As of January 2025, Esperanto UD contains one document (Manufest de Prago) annotated with Universal Dependencies.

## Tokenization and Word Segmentation

Esperanto words are delimited by whitespace or punctuation, and no tokens in any of the UD Esperanto corpus currently contain whitespace. Only a few multiword tokens should be used for Esperanto clitics, such as dank'al ("danke" + "al", "thanks to"), or l' (reduced form of the definite article "la").

## Treebanks

There are [N](../treebanks/eo-comparison.html) Esperanto UD treebanks:

**Instruction**: Treebank-specific pages are generated automatically from the README file in the treebank repository and
from the data in the latest release. Link to the respective `*-index.html` page in the `treebanks` folder, using the language code
and the treebank code in the file name.
