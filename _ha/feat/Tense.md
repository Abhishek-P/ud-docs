Tense is typically a feature of [verbs](u-pos/VERB).

Tense is a feature that specifies the time when the action took /
takes / will take place, in relation to a reference point.
The reference is often the moment of producing the sentence,
but it can be also another event in the context.

### <a name="Fut">`Fut`</a>: future tense

The future tense denotes actions that will happen after a reference point;
in the prototypical case, the reference point is the moment of producing
the sentence.

#### Examples

- _bà <b>zaːkà</b> ganiː ba //_ “You won't see any.”


### <a name="Pred">`Pred`</a>: predictive tense

TODO

#### Examples

- <b>_tâː</b> bar̃ mâː kunyàː à gidaː //_ "She will bring shame on your house."
