In Hausa, aspect is a feature of auxiliaries and particules that specifies the duration and completion of processes in time.

### <a name="Aor">`Aor`</a>: aorist

The aorist expresses semantic values of habituality, repetition, general truth and anteriority. It can also be also used in backgrounded contexts, and for the expression of a wish. It is not time referenced.

#### Example

- _<b>baːkà</b> mânceːwà //_ "You won't forget."

### <a name="Perf">`Perf`</a>: perfect aspect

The action has been / will have been completed. Since there is
emphasis on one point on the time scale (the point of completion),
this aspect does not work well with the present tense. For example,
Czech morphology can create present forms of perfective verbs but
these actually have a future meaning.

#### Examples
- _<b>an</b> shânyaː tà //_ "They dried it."

### <a name="Prog">`Prog`</a>: progressive aspect

The progressive aspect is used to indicate ongoing processes.

#### Examples
- _aikìn màːshîn <b>yakèː</b> yîː //_ "He drives a motorcycle."

### <a name="Hab">`Hab`</a>: habitual aspect

English simple present has this aspect.

#### Examples
- _<b>akàn</b> sàːmi matsalaː irìn na wânnan //_ " We usually get that kind of problem."

### <a name="Iter">`Iter`</a>: iterative / frequentative aspect

Denotes repeated action.

#### Examples
- _munàː ta kaucè hanyàː //_ " We kept straying from the path."
