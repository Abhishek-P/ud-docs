In Hausa, aspect is a feature of auxiliaries and particles that specifies the duration and completion of processes in time.

### <a name="Aor">`Aor`</a>: aorist aspect

The aorist expresses semantic values of habituality, repetition, general truth and anteriority. It can also be also used in backgrounded contexts, and for the expression of a wish. It is not time referenced.

#### Example

- _<b>baːkà</b> mânceːwà //_ "You won't forget."

### <a name="Perf">`Perf`</a>: perfect aspect

The perfect aspect refers to a process that has been / will have been completed. In a backgrounded context, it is replaced by the backgrounded perfect aspect (PerfBkg), and by the negative perfect (PerfNeg) to express negative polarity. 

#### Examples
- _<b>an</b> shânyaː tà //_ "They dried it."

### <a name="PerfBkg">`PerfBkg`</a>: backgrounded perfect aspect

The backgrounded perfect aspect occurs in contexts where the process is subordinated to a another process, or to a focused item, e.g in a subordinate clause, a cleft or a content question. 

#### Examples
- _ìdan <b>niz</b> zoː > sai ìn zakà ìn ƙaːràː //_ "When I arrive, I will add more." 

### <a name="PerfNeg">`PerfNeg`</a>: negative perfect aspect

The negative perfect aspect replaces the perfect aspect to express negative polarity. 

#### Examples
- _<b>bài</b> daɗèː ba //_ "He did not stay long."

### <a name="Prog">`Prog`</a>: progressive aspect

The progressive aspect is used to indicate ongoing processes. In a backgrounded context, it is replaced by the backgrounded progressive aspect (ProgfBkg), and by the negative progressive (ProgfNeg) to express negative polarity. 

#### Examples
- _aikìn màːshîn <b>yakèː</b> yîː //_ "He drives a motorcycle."

### <a name="ProgBkg">`ProgBkg`</a>: backgrounded progressive aspect

The backgrounded progressive aspect (ProgfBkg) occurs in contexts where the process is subordinated to a another process, or to a focused item, e.g in a subordinate clause, a cleft or a content question.

#### Examples
- _tôː ƙasà >+ 	<b>mukà</b> tohoːwàː //_ "Well, we travelled ON FOOT."

### <a name="ProgNeg">`ProgNeg`</a>: negative progressive aspect

The negative progressive aspect replaces the progressive aspect to express negative polarity. 

#### Examples
- _<b>baː'àː</b> cêːwaː koːmiː //  //_ "We don't say anything."

### <a name="Hab">`Hab`</a>: habitual aspect

The habitual aspect expresses a process that tends to occur frequently.

#### Examples
- _<b>akàn</b> sàːmi matsalaː irìn na wânnan //_ " We usually get that kind of problem."

### <a name="Iter">`Iter`</a>: iterative / frequentative aspect

The iterative / frequentative aspect is combined with the progressive aspect to denote a repeated action.

#### Examples
- _munàː <b>ta</b> kaucè hanyàː //_ " We kept straying from the path."
