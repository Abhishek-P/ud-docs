# UD Discussion

This page collects links to pages where UD guidelines (and other issues) are discussed or were discussed in the past.
These pages do **not** have the status of guidelines, so proposals contained therein may conflict with current guidelines.
These pages are an archive of working group materials, not a broad discussion forum.
If you want to discuss individual annotation questions, use the
[Github issue tracker](https://github.com/universaldependencies/docs/issues).
