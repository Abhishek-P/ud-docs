Boolean feature of verbs ([VERB]() and [AUX]()), marking a word as
being in connegative form.

In Moksha, some negations are formed combining the auxiliary past (first preterit) negative verb (*ашезь*), the conjunctive auxiliary negative verb (*афоль*), the prohibitive auxiliary negative verb (*тят*), or the converb/participle negative auxiliary (*апак*)
and the main verb, the latter of which appears in the connegative form.

### <a name="Yes">`Yes`</a>: word is connegative

Note that there is no `No` value. If the word is not connegative, the
`Connegative` feature will not appear.

#### Examples

* [mdf] _ашезень <b>сода</b>_ "I didn't <b>know</b>"
* [mdf] _изене <b>сява</b>_ "I didn't <b>take</b> it"

* [mdf] _афолень <b>сода</b>_ "I wouldn't <b>know</b>"

* [mdf] _тяк <b>сява</b>_ "Don't <b>take</b> it"
