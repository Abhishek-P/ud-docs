### Definition
The tag X is used for words that for some reason cannot be assigned a real part-of-speech category. It should be used very restrictively.
A special usage of X is for cases of code-switching where it is not possible (or meaningful) to analyze the intervening language grammatically (and where the dependency relation [flat:foreign]() is typically used in the syntactic analysis). This usage does not extend to ordinary loan words which should be assigned a normal part-of-speech. For example, in *φόρεσε το <b>κραγιόν</b> της* `she applied her lipstick', *<b>κραγιόν</b>* `lipstick' is an ordinary NOUN (it is a loan from French).

Αbbreviations should be categorized by their common use and not as an X, e.g. 
*Κ.Ε.Α.Ν: ΚΟΜΜΑ ΕΘΝΙΚΗΣ ΑΝΤΙΣΤΑΣΗΣ* "Party of National Resistance"
should be assigned the PoS tag [NOUN]()and the feature [Abbr=Yes](). 

Tokens in non-Greek characters are assigned the tag X.

(Only the morphological aspects are discussed here; tokens morphologically tagged with “X” have a syntactic function that will be assigned to them at syntactic annotation time).

### Examples

-	*H αναπαραγωγή δεν θα είναι εντελώς <b>Lossless</b>*. "Reproduction won't be fully <b>Lossless</b>."
-	*Κάντο <b>φοργουόρντ</b> σε μένα.* Lit. do it <b>forward</b> to me "Forward it to me."
