### <a name="Fin">`Fin`</a>: finite verb

Rule of thumb: if it has non-empty [Mood](el-feat/Mood), it is finite.
In Modern Greek this applies to indicative and imperative forms.

#### Examples

- _γράφω, γράφεις, γράφει, γράφουμε, γράφετε, γράφουν_ ;“I write, you write, he/she/it writes, we write, you write, they write”
- _γράφε, γράφετε, γράψε, γράψετε_ “carry” (imperative in different persons and numbers)
- _είμαι, είσαι, είναι, είμαστε, είσαστε, είναι_ “I am, you are, he/she/it is, we are, you are, they are”
- _έχω, έχεις, έχει, έχουμε, έχετε, έχουν_ “I have, you have, he/she/it has, we have, you have, they have”

### <a name="Inf">`Inf`</a>: infinitive

As "Infinitive" is marked a verb form of Modern Greek that is received from the _perfective_ form of the verb and is used with the auxiliary _έχω_
 "have" to form certain composite tenses. It has no other usage in the language and it is not  used as the lemma form (as infinitives are traditionally used).

#### Examples

- _έχω γράψει_ “Ι have written”
- _είχα γράψει_ “Ι had written”
- _έχω γραφτεί_ "I have been written" (passive morphology)
- _είχα γραφτεί_ "I had been written" (passive morphology)


### <a name="Part">`Part`</a>: participle

Participle is a non-finite verb form that shares properties of verbs
and adjectives. Modern Greek has a medio-/passive (or deponent) participle ending in _-μένος/-μένη/-μένο_ that corresponds to the Ancient Greek present tense medio-/passive participle.  In limited use are some participles  ending in _-θεις, -θείσα, -θεν_ inherited from classical Greek in the  medio-/passive past tense. 

Participles inflect for [Gender](el-feat/Gender), [Case](el-feat/Case) and [Number](el-feat/Number) and are marked for [Voice](el-feat/Voice) but not [Tense](el-feat/Tense) and [Mood](el-feat/Mood). 

#### Examples

- _γραμμένος, γραμμένη, γραμμένο_; “written” (medio-/passive (or deponent) participle lemma in the three genders)
- _προαναφερθείς, προαναφερθείσα, προαναφερθέν_ (past medio-/passive participle (or deponent) lemma in the three genders)

### <a name="Conv">`Conv`</a>: converb, transgressive

Non-inflecting verb forms ending in *-όντας, -ώντας* (adverbial participles) are non-finite forms that share properties of adverbs and verbs. They are assigned the tag [VERB](), a lemma in *-όντας, -ώντας*, the specification [VerbForm=Conv] and are tagged for [Aspect]() and [Voice](). 


#### Examples

-	*τρέχοντας*  "running"
-	_τρώγοντας_ "eating"
-	_τραγουδώντας_ "singing"
