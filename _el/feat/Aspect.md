Aspect in Modern Greek  specifies the point of view the speaker adopts, that is, whether he views the event as  a completed whole or  he focues on the temporal structure of the event (continuation, duration, iteration). Modern Greek verbs do not provide different lemmas for their two morphologically distinct aspectual types.


### <a name="Imp">`Imp`</a>: imperfect aspect

The event is viewed from within: it took / takes / will take some time span and there is no
information whether and when it was / will be completed.

#### Examples

* _γράφω_ "I write or I am writting"
* _θα γράφω_ "I will be writting"
* _έγραφα_ "I was writing"
* _κοιμάμαι_ "I sleep or I am sleeping"
* _θα κοιμάμαι_ "I will be sleeping"
* _κοιμόμουνα_ "I was sleeping"
* _ψήνομαι_  "I am baked or I am being baked"
* _θα ψήνομαι_  "I will be being baked"
* _ψηνόμουνα_ "I was being baked"


### <a name="Perf">`Perf`</a>: perfect aspect

The event is viewed as a (completed) whole. The verb form that combines perfect aspect and past tense is independent. All other verb forms that bear the feature-value pair [Aspect=Perf]() should be supported by an auxiliary, namely _έχω_ or _θα_.

#### Examples
* _έγραψα_ "I wrote" (past, perfect)
* _θα γράψω_ "I will write"
* _έχω γράψει_ "I have written"
* _κοιμήθηκα_ "I slept" (past, perfect)
* _θα κοιμηθώ_ "I will sleep"
* _έχω κοιμηθεί_ "I have slept"
* _ψήθηκα_  "I was baked" (past, perfect)
* _θα ψηθώ_ "I will be baked"
* _έχω ψηθεί_ "I have been baked"
