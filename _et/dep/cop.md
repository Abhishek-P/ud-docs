A copula is the relation between the complement of a copular verb and the copular verb. 'olema' is the only copular verb in Estonian UD.
The predicative is the head of the copular clause, and also the governor of the cop dependency. As it is hard to distinguish copular clauses from existential clauses almost all clauses with _olema_ ("be") are copular clauses. _olema_ has POS tag AUX and it can not have dependents.
