## Person[iobj]
In Nahuatl, the subject, object, and indirect object of a Verb all have corresponding
agreement morphology for Person and Number. The Person argument for subject and
object are already included in the universal features. Here we define the
Person agreement for indirect object, Person[iobj]

### <a name="1">`1`</a>: first person indirect object argument

Examples: [nhi] _o<b>nech</b>ilwikeh keni itoka_ `They told [me] what is name is.`

### <a name="2">`2`</a>: second person indirect object argument

Examples: [nhi] _ni<b>mits</b>walikilis_ `I will bring it to [you].`

### <a name="3">`3`</a>: third person indirect object argument

Examples: [nhi] _oni<b>k</b>tlalilih_ `I put it on [him/her/it]`
