# UD for Mbyá Guaraní <span class="flagspan"><img class="flag" src="../../flags/svg/PY.svg" /></span> <span class="flagspan" style="padding-left:1em"><img class="flag" src="../../flags/svg/AR.svg" /></span> <span class="flagspan" style="padding-left:1em"><img class="flag" src="../../flags/svg/BR.svg" /></span>

This is a brief overview of the UD annotation for Mbyá Guaraní. A full set of annotation guidelines can be downloaded at [gpythomas.com/Mbya_Treebank_Guidelines.pdf](https://www.gpythomas.com/Mbya_Treebank_Guidelines.pdf) and will be incorporated into the UD Mbya_Guarani documentation in the next release.

These guidelines are very much a work in progress. They are meant to adapt [Dooley's (2015)](https://www.sil.org/resources/archives/72343) analysis of Mbyá to the UD framework:

* Dooley, Robert A. (2015). Léxico Guarani, Dialeto Mbyá -- com informações úteis para o ensino médio, a aprendizagem e a pesquisa lingüística Brasília, Brazil: Summer Institute of Linguistics.

## Tokenization and Word Segmentation

* In general, words are delimited by white spaces or punctuation, Whitespaces or punctuation may appear in some abbreviations or numeric expressions.

* In order to capture interactions between syntax and morphology, clause level nominalizers (including the suffix _-a_) and adverbializers (including the switch reference markers _vy_ and _ramo_) have been represented as syntactic words.

* Glottal stops are represented by the apostrophe, which can therefore be part of a word. Reduplicated units are joined to their host by a hyphen.

## Morphology

### Tags

* Mbyá uses all 17 Universal POS categories:

| Open class words | Closed class words | Other |
|------------------|--------------------|-------|
| ADJ              | ADP                | PUNCT |
| ADV              | AUX                | SYM   |
| INTJ             | CCONJ              | X     |
| NOUN             | DET                |       |
| PROPN            | NUM                |       |

|                  | SCONJ              |       |

### Features

* Verbs are inflected for person, number and clusivity:

  * [Person]() has three possible values: `1`, `2`, `3`.
    * Person uses the layers [subj](/u/feat/Person-subj.html) and [obj](/u/feat/Person-obj.html).
  * [Number]() has two possible values: `Sing` and `Plur`.
    * Number uses the layer [psor](/u/feat/Number-psor.html).
  * [Clusivity]() has two possible values, `In` and `Ex`.
    * Clusivity uses the layers [subj](/u/feat/Clusivity-subj.html) and [obj](/u/feat/Clusivity-obj.html).

* Verbs have a subcategorization feature [Subcat]() with four possible values: `Ditr`(ansitive), `Intr`(ansitive), `Indir`(ect) and `Tran`(sitive).

* Verbs have a [VerbForm]() feature with five possible values: `Fin`(ite), `Inf`(inite), `Part`(iciple), `Post`(posed verb), `Prov`(erb), `Ser`(ial), `Vnoun` (verbal noun).

* Verbs have an optional [Mood]() feature with three possible values: `Des`(iderative), `Ind`(icative), `Imp`(erative).

* Verbs have an optional [Polarity]() feature with one possible value, `Neg`.

* Nouns can be used as predicates without copula, and inflect for person, number and clusivity like inactive intransitive verbs. They have Person, Number and Clusitivity features.

* Pronouns have a [PronType]() feature with seven possible values: `Add`, `Dem`, `Ind`, `Int`, `Neg`, `Prs`, `Tot`.
  * The feature value `PronType=Add` has been added for additive pronouns that are unspecified for definiteness (e.g. _amboae_, 'another' or 'the other')

## Syntax

### Core Arguments, Oblique Arguments and Adjuncts

* Subjects are noun phrases without postpositions that are the sole cross-referenced argument of intransitive verbs, or the argument of transitive verbs that is cross-referenced with an active agreement marker.

* Objects are noun phrases without postpositions that are cross-referenced on transitive verbs with inactive agreement markers. They may be followed by a differential object marker.

* Postpositional noun phrases are considered oblique.

### Non-verbal Clauses

* Mbyá Guaraní is an omnipredicative language. Nouns and other non-verbal open word classes can be used predicatively without copula. In certain environments, non-verbal predicates are introduced by the copula _iko_.

### Language Specific Syntactic Relations

* There are 6 relation subtypes in UD Mbya_Guarani:

| Relation		|	Description																						|
|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| advmod:sentcon	| Adverbial modifier used as sentence initial discourse connective									|
| [dep:mod]()		| Modifier underspecified for the syntactic category of its head									|
| [compound:svc]()	| Used for a variety of complex predicates, notably serial verb and postposed verb constructions	|
| [dislocated:cleft]()	| Used for cleft constructions that lack a copula													|
| [obl:sentcon]()	| Nominal modifier used as a sentence initial discourse connective									|
| [parataxis:rep]()	| Used to relate a reported speech form to a verb of speech report analyzed as its head				|
