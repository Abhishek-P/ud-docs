In Amharic, `Case` is a lexical feature of [adpositions](u-pos/ADP) and
describes the case meaning that the adposition contributes to the phrase
in which it appears.

Not all Amharic adpositions are annotated with a `Case` feature. Some
adpositions that have the feature are incorporated in a [verb](u-pos/VERB)
form on the surface; they are treated as separate syntactic words in UD and
may depend directly on the verb stem.

Incorporated prepositions have been also described as applicative morphemes
that make the verb agree with a prepositional argument (in addition to the
agreement with the subject). This means that the prepositional argument becomes
a core object and the valency of the verb is altered.

### <a name="Ben">`Ben`</a>: benefactive

The benefactive case corresponds to the English preposition _for_.
While in other languages the benefactive case may cover also actions whose result
is not advantageous for the person affected, in Amharic this case is used only
for good things, and the bad ones are marked differently (see below).

#### Examples

* አስተናጋጁ ሻይ አመጣ<b>ላ</b>ቸውና ጠጡ ። / _'äsətänagadžu šajə 'ämäţa<b>l</b>ačäwəna ţäţu ._
  “The waitress brought them tea and they drank.” (lit. the-host tea brought-she-BEN-them-and drank-they)

### <a name="Mal">`Mal`</a>: malefactive

Like benefactive, the malefactive denotes an entity (person) that is affected
by an action in which it does not participate directly (neither as the actor
nor as the patient). However, contrary to the benefactive, here the effect of
the action is disadvantageous for the person.

#### Examples

* ገንዘቡ ጠፋ<b>በ</b>ት ። / _gänəzäbu ţäfa<b>b</b>ätə ._
  “She lost her money.” (lit. the-money lost-she-MAL-him(it))

### <a name="Loc">`Loc`</a>: locative

Some applicatives (incorporated prepositions) have locative meaning. This type
is less frequent and less frequently discussed in the literature than the
others.

#### Examples

* መንገዱ የመጣን<b>በ</b>ት ነው ። / _mänəgädu jämäţanə<b>bä</b>tə näwə ._
  “That is where we came from.” (lit. the-way that-came-we-LOC-it it-is)

### <a name="Ins">`Ins`</a>: instrumental

In some contexts the preposition _bä_ has the interpretation of the
instrumental.

#### Examples

* አስቴር <b>በ</b>መጥረጊያው መስኮት ጠረገች<b>በ</b>ት ። / _'äsəterə <b>bä</b>mäţərägijawə mäsəkotə ţärägäčə<b>bä</b>tə ._
  “Esther wiped the window with a broom.” (lit. Esther with-the-broom window wiped-she-INS-her)

### <a name="Abl">`Abl`</a>: ablative

The preposition ከ / _kä_ signifies the direction from some point.

#### Examples

* <b>ከ</b>ሱቅ ሱቅ ሲዞር አስመሸኝ ። / _<b>kä</b>suqə suqə sizorə 'äsəmäšäňə ._
  “He made me wander from store to store.” (lit. from-store store that-he-turns made-he-me)
