### Description

Tense feature matches the inflectional endings in verbs.  In Uralic grammars
there have been various practices in refering to present/future tense and
past/preterite tense, in Universal dependencies we use `Pres` for common
non-past and `Past` for common past, unless language has more complex tense
system. Many grammars give descriptions of e.g. perfect and pluperfect tenses,
but if it's based on auxiliary verb constructions, this is not marked on UD
level.
