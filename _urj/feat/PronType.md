### Description

This feature typically applies to pronouns, determiners, pronominal numerals
(quantifiers) and pronominal adverbs. This feature is also used for pro-words
that are not under `PRON` part of speech, e.g. pro-adjectives and pro-adverbs.
The values used in Uralic follow universal guidelines. In some grammars there is
quantifier or quantor type, this seems to map to universal value `Ind`.
