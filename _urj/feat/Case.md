Uralic languages typically have rich case systems, most of the values are as
described in the universal guidelines, there may be a need to add some when new
Uralic languages are described. Notes to keep in mind:

* cases like genitive-accusative or nominative-accusative should be treated
  uniformly within a treebank and documented (also for e.g.
  inessive-elative if such combination has fallen together / is lacking); either
  systematically use a case that morphophonology attests or the syntax or
  semantics
* Distinguishing between marginal cases and derivations (e.g. Adverbial) has to
  be done on a case by case basis. Potential evidence against Case feature
  includes: no phonological evidence (e.g. lack of vowel harmony indicates a
  postpositional enclitic / compound), no syntactic evidence (e.g. lack of case
  agreement in noun phrases) and limited productivity. Be systematic.

#### Layered cases

Some Uralic languages allow stacking of case suffixes, which might be
implemented in UD as layered annotations or lexicalising the inflected form.
This is up for future discussions.
