### Description

Aspect is typically a verbal feature, along with tense and mood. Aspect in
Uralic languages has at most the universally defined values, but care needs to
be taken when comparing aspect values to traditional grammars:

* Imperfect in Uralic tradition is [Tense=Past](), i.e. preterite in UD,
* Frequentative is `Aspect=Iter`, however, it is not necessary to use the
  feature if it's a lexicalised derivational feature and not available in
  converted systems


#### Examples

The Aspect feature is not used in currently existing Uralic treebanks.
