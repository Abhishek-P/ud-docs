### Description

Mood is a verbal feature. In Uralics it is often described together with
[Tense](), few things to note:

* Present indicatives and past indicatives should include both Mood and Tense
  features.
* There may be discrepancies between Uralic tradition of names for: potential,
  jussive, optative, eventive and necessive and the UD descriptions thereof
