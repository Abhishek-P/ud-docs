`compound` is one of the three UD relations UD for compounding,
together with [fixed]() and [flat]().

In Uralic languages many types of compounds act as single orthographical unit,
and do not need dependency relations. When compounds are written with spaces
against standard orthography, the dependency used shoud be [goeswith](). When
multiword compounds are written with spaces and e.g. hyphen, compound dep can
be used.
