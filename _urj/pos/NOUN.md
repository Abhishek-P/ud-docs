### Description

Nouns in Uralic languages work similarly as with Universal guidelines. In some
Uralic grammatic descriptions there is a large number of infinitives or deverbal
nouns, that can be categorised under `NOUN`, in this case, it is also
recommended to use the noun lexeme as the lemma form.

#### Examples

* [fi] _talo_ "house", _tyttö_ "girl"
