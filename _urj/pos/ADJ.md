### Definition

`ADJ` pos tag is used for adjectives. Adjectives are relatively standard
in Uralic grammars and easy to spot, i.e. follow the Universal guidelines,
though some Uralic lexicons do not differentiate nominals into adjectives and
nouns. Less obvious cases in Uralic (some are defined in Universal too):

* Pro-adjectives are tagged as `ADJ`.
* Ordinal numerals are tagged as `ADJ`.
* Participles when lexicalised are tagged as `ADJ`.

#### Examples

* [fi] _paha_ "evil"
* [fi] _sellainen_ "like that"
* [fi] _ensimmäinen_ "first"
