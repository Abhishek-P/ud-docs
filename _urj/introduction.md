# Introduction

The Uralic dependencies documentation serves for two purposes:

1. It's a collective documentation looking at differences of Uralic languages
   with examples and hopefully statistics
1. It's an additive to Universal documentations telling specific recommendations
   and extensions that should be taken into consideration when reading applying
   UD to a Uralic language; e.g. many Uralic language grammars will not talk
   about [determiners](../../u/pos/DET.html), we give recommendations on what to
   annotate as DET.

This project is a first attempt to co-ordinate unity within a language group
annotation principles and document common best practices. The project is
maintained by [ACL SIG for Uralic Languages](https://acl-sigur.github.io/).

### Treebanks

* [Estonian](../../et/),
* [Finnish](../../fi/),
* [Hungarian](../../hu/),
* [Karelian](../../krl/)
* [Komi-Permyak](../../kpv/)
* [Komi-Zyrian](../../kpv/)
* [Livvi](../../krl/)
* [North Sámi](../../sme/)
* [Skolt Sami](../../sms/)


### Uralic morphological and syntactic analysers

There’s a solid history within uralistic computational linguistics towards
rule-based parsing. It should be noted that many of the traditional parsers
can be relatively easily mapped to Universal Dependencies scheme. See for
example [North Sámi](../../sme/) or [Karelian](../../krl/) for Universal
Dependencies treebanks that have been build in this manner.
