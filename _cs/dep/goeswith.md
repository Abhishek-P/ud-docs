This relation links two parts of a word that are separated in text
that is not well edited.
The head is always the first part, the other parts are attached to it with the `goeswith` relation
(for consistency, similarly as in [flat](), [fixed]() and [conj]()).
Note that only the last part may be annotated with `SpaceAfter=No`.
