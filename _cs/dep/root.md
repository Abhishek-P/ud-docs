The `root` grammatical relation points to the root of the sentence. A
fake node `ROOT` is used as the governor. The `ROOT` node is indexed
with 0, since the indexing of real words in the sentence starts at 1.

~~~ sdparse
ROOT Miluju indická jídla . \n ROOT I-love Indian food .
root(ROOT-1, Miluju)
root(ROOT-7, I-love)

Since release 1.2 of the Czech UD treebank,
there is just one node with the `root` dependency relation in every
tree. If the main predicate is not present (due to
[ellipsis](http://universaldependencies.org/cs/overview/specific-syntax.html#ellipsis))
and there are
multiple orphaned dependents, the dependent that is highest in the obliqueness hierarchy is promoted to
the head (root) position and the other orphans are attached to it.

An example sentence-like segment that lacks the main verb:
_A co na to [říká] MF?_
“And what [does] MF [say] to it?”

~~~ sdparse
ROOT A co na to MF ? \n ROOT And what to it MF ?
root(ROOT-1, MF-6)
root(ROOT-9, MF-14)
orphan(MF-6, co)
orphan(MF-14, what)
orphan(MF-6, to-5)
orphan(MF-14, it)
case(to-5, na)
case(it, to-12)
cc(MF-6, A)
cc(MF-14, And)
punct(MF-6, ?-7)
punct(MF-14, ?-15)
