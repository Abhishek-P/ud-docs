### Definition

The tag `X` is used for words that for some reason cannot be assigned
a real part-of-speech category. It should be used very restrictively.
Cases include:

- __Unintelligible material:__ For example, gibberish or words that cannot
be fully transcribed.

- __Word fragments:__ This includes non-initial parts of a [goeswith]() sequence.
Depending on a language's tokenization practices, it may also apply to
normally bound affixes that have been split off.

- __Unanalyzed foreign words:__ Cases of code-switching where it is not possible 
(or meaningful) to analyze the intervening language grammatically. 
See the page on [Foreign Expressions and Code-Switching](/foreign.html).
Note that this usage does not extend to ordinary loan words:
e.g., in _he put on a large sombrero_, _sombrero_ is an ordinary [NOUN]().

Note that [SYM]() is appropriate for certain miscellaneous forms that are not _spelled_
as regular words, but may be _pronounced_ with regular words.

### Examples

- _And then he just <b>xfgh pdl jklw</b>_
