### Definition

The tag `X` is used for words that for some reason cannot be assigned
a real part-of-speech category. It should be used very restrictively.
Cases include:

- __Unintelligible material:__ For example, gibberish or words that cannot
be fully transcribed.

- __Word fragments:__ This includes truncated words (as in speech) as well as
non-initial parts of a [goeswith]() sequence.
Depending on a language's tokenization practices, it may also apply to
normally bound affixes that have been split off.

- __Unanalyzed foreign words:__ Cases of code-switching where it is not possible 
(or meaningful) to analyze the intervening language grammatically. 
See the page on [Foreign Expressions and Code-Switching](/foreign.html).
Note that this usage does not extend to ordinary loan words:
e.g., in _he put on a large sombrero_, _sombrero_ is an ordinary [NOUN]().

`X` is discouraged for words that clearly belong to the language, even if they are idiosyncratic 
in form or distribution and thus do not neatly fit into other syntactic categories.
For example, _etc._ in English is not an obvious fit for any category, but a regular 
category ([NOUN]()) was deemed the closest fit. In other cases, one of the other
non-canonical parts of speech ([PART](), [NUM](), [SYM](), and [PUNCT]()) may be suitable.

### Examples
