### Definition

An interjection is a word that is used most often as an exclamation or
part of an exclamation. It typically expresses an emotional reaction,
is not syntactically related to other accompanying expressions, and
may include a combination of sounds not otherwise found in the
language.

In keeping with the general [tagging principles](/u/overview/morphology.html#tagging-principles),
a word used to signal an exclamation in a particular context does not
automatically qualify as `INTJ`. For example, nouns and adjectives with
emotionally valenced semantics should only be tagged `INTJ` in exclamations
if such usage is considered to be lexicalized as a separate sense.

As a special case of interjections, we recognize feedback particles
such as _yes_, _no_, _uhuh_, etc.

### Examples

- _psst_
- _ouch_
- _bravo_
- _hello_
