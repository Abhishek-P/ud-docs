The specialization of `vocative`, `vocative:mention` used for social media @-mentions and it links the addressee (i.e. the used called out by means of the @-mention) to its host sentence. This follows earlier examples for Italian and Irish social media treebanks.

~~~ sdparse
@user ÃŽÈ™i bate dracu' nevasta ðŸ˜‚
vocative:mention(dracu', @user)
~~~

However, just like hashtags, whenever they are syntactically integrated into the sentence, they are annotated according to their actual syntactic role.

~~~ sdparse
vorba lui @user
nmod(vorba, @user)
~~~
