# Tokenization

## Word Boundaries

#### Demonstrative and Emphatic Suffixes
* Frequently occurring affixes such as demonstrative and emphatic suffixes are always separated from preceding tokens and considered to be tokens themselves:
    * _cuci-sium &rarr cuci sium_

#### Conjoined Tokens
* Where forms of a significant part of speech such as the **article**, the **copula**, or **possessive pronouns** occur in reduced or altered form when combined with other tokens, these forms are considered to be conjoined tokens:
    * _cosin, iarsint, isnaib, frisna, ón, isin_
    * _manam -> mo anam, m'athair -> mo athair_

#### Compounds
* separate or mwe?
    * _drochcostud_

#### Verbal Complex
* preverbs and infixed pronouns considered part of the same token and kept together:
    * _dagníu \[do-a-gníu\]_

## Normalizing Orthography

#### LENITION, BRACKETS, EDITOR-SPECIFIC NORMALIZATION
