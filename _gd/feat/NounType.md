* _ainmean_ "names" - plural form.

### <a name="Prs">`Prs`</a>: personal names

These are proper nouns referring to people.
They are often multiword expressions and individual parts may be tagged `PART` or `DET` or `ADJ`.
In ARCOSG they are tagged with XPOS beginning `Nn`.

* _Ealasaid Nic Ille Bhàin_
* _Mac an Deòir_

### <a name="Top">`Top`</a>: toponyms

These are proper nouns referring to places, be they settlements, countries, lochs, mountains or rivers.
They do not show as much case variation as common nouns in modern Scottish Gaelic and typically show the genitive by merely leniting.
Most of the tokens in ARCOSG tagged with XPOS `Nt` are toponyms.
They can be single words or multiple words joined with the `flat:name` relation.
