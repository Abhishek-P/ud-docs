This applies to nodes of type `NOUN` and `PROPN`.

### <a name="Chr">`Chr`</a>: chrematonyms

These are proper names that refer to publications and other creative works.
Multiword chrematonyms tagged PROPN are usually borrowings from English.
Song titles like _Òran na Cloiche_ and _Nach truagh leat mi 's tu 'n Eirinn_ are tagged with their usual grammatical structure.

#### Examples

* _Gairm_
* _Scottish Studies_

### <a name="Cmn">`Cmn`</a>: common nouns

These are nouns that are usually written in lower case and refer to things in general.
They may be concrete or abstract.
Most of the words in ARCOSG with an XPOS starting `Nc` are common nouns but there are a few exceptions.

#### Examples

* _dùil_ "expectation"
* _àite_ "place"
* _phàipeir_ "paper" - lenited and slenderised form, in the dative case.
* _ainmean_ "names" - plural form.

### <a name="Eth">`Eth`</a>: ethnonyms

These are proper names that refer to groups of people.

#### Examples

* _Leòdhasaich_ "people from Lewis"
* _Sasannach_ "Englishman"
* _Uibhistich_ "people from Uist"

### <a name="Glt">`Glt`</a>: glottonyms

These are proper names that refer to languages.

#### Examples

* _Beurla_ "English"
* _Fraingis_ "French"
* _Gàidhlig_ "Gaelic"

### <a name="Nau">`Nau`</a>: nautonyms

These are proper names that refer to boats and are often toponyms and the English-language name may be used in news items.

#### Examples

### <a name="Nos">`Nos`</a>: nosonyms

These are proper names that refer to diseases and are usually abbreviations.
Longer expressions like _an galar ronnach_ "foot and mouth disease" or _an cnatan mòr_ "flu" are tagged with their usual grammatical structure.

#### Examples

* _AIDS_
* _ISA_ = Infectious Salmon Anaemia

### <a name="Org">`Org`</a>: organisational names

These are proper names referring to organisations.
Usually they are abbreviations.
The convention used by the BBC is to give the English-language abbreviation, say RSPB but translate the name, here _Comann Rìoghail Dìon nan Eun_ "Royal Society for the Protection of Birds".
In this case _RSPB_ is `PROPN` but the longer expression is tagged with the normal grammatical structure.

#### Examples

* _CalMac_ short for Caledonian MacBrayne 
* _NATO_ 

### <a name="Prs">`Prs`</a>: personal names

These are proper nouns referring to people.
They are often multiword expressions and individual parts may be tagged `PART` or `DET` or `ADJ`.
In ARCOSG they are tagged with XPOS beginning `Nn`.

#### Examples

* _Jack Straw_
* _Ealasaid Nic Ille Bhàin_
* _Mac an Deòir_

### <a name="Top">`Top`</a>: toponyms

These are proper nouns referring to places, be they settlements, countries, lochs, mountains or rivers.
They do not show as much case variation as common nouns in modern Scottish Gaelic and typically show the genitive by merely leniting.
Most of the tokens in ARCOSG tagged with XPOS `Nt` are toponyms.
They can be single words or multiple words joined with the `flat:name` relation.

#### Examples

* _Bàgh a' Chaisteil_ "Castlebay"
* _Bharraigh_ "Barra", lenited form
