The default is the indicative mood which is not currently marked.

### <a name="Cnd">`Cnd`</a>: conditional mood

This is used for things that might happen, but also for things that happened habitually in the past.
It applies to verbs.

#### Examples

* _Bha e mar gum <b>biodh</b> e smaoineachadh._ "It was as if he were thinking." (f07\_056)
* _nuair a <b>dh’fhalbhadh</b> daoine o 'n taigh <b>thigeadh</b> feadhainn agus <b>dh’fhalbhadh</b> iad le na beathaichean aca_ "When people left the house (other) people would come and they would leave with their animals" (n06\_000b)

### <a name="Imp">`Imp`</a>: imperative mood

The imperative mood is used to give a command, express advice, or make a request.
It applies to verbs.

#### Examples

* _“Na <b>bi</b> 'faighneachd," thuirt Caimbeul._ '"Don't be asking", said Campbell.' (f02\_054b)
* _<b>Can</b> g' eil thusa 'g iarraidh job ann an telebhisean._ "Say you want a job in television." (f02\_063)

### <a name="Int">`Int`</a>: interrogative mood

The interrogative mood is used for the interrogative forms _an_ (affirmative) and _nach_ (negative) of the copula.
Otherwise we use `PartType=Int` on the particle.

#### Examples

* _Rudeigin mu dheidhinn sgrìob a Venezuela, <b>an</b> e?_ "Something about a trip to Venezuela, isn't it?" (f02\_054a)
