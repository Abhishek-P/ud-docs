We annotate the type of the adverb because it is needed for validating predicate external complements.

For example, the adverb in _Tha mi an-seo_ 'I am here' is the predicate (`xcomp:pred`), but the adverb in _mar a bha mi an-dè_ 'as I was yesterday' is simply an adverbial modifier (`advmod`) because I can be here (and I am) but I can't be yesterday.

### <a name="Tim">`Tim`</a>: Temporal adverbs

### <a name="Man">`Man`</a>: Adverbs of manner
