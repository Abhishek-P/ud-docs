There are two constructions that use a copula and a relative clause modifier, _'S ann_ and _'S e_.

* _'S ann_ or _Sann_ fronts adjectives, adverbs, APs, PPs and adverbial clauses.
  * If what has been fronted has no overt subject, as is the case for adjectives, adverbs, APs and PPs, then it is linked to the relative clause modifier by `csubj:cleft`.
  * However, if it is itself a clause with an explicit head, then see `csubj:outer`.
* _'S e_ or _'Se_ fronts an NP, which is linked to a relative clause modifier of indefinite reference by `csubj:cleft`.
* Where there is a definite NP, this is not in a relative clause but linked by `nsubj`.
