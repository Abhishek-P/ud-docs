The `Person` feature for Kʼicheʼ follows the standard UD guidelines for nouns, adjectives,
determiners and adverbs. However, verbs can contain agreement features on person for both the
subject and the object, so the Kʼicheʼ treebank follows the UD description for
[layered features](/u/overview/feat-layers.html), defining
[Person[subj]=1,2,3](/u/feat/Person-subj.html) and
[Person[obj]=1,2,3](/u/feat/Person-obj.html).

Transitive verbs will have subject and object agreement and intransitive verbs will have
only subject agreement. Transitive verbs with passive or antipassive morphology will have
only subject agreement.
