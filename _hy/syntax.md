# Syntax

The syntactic annotation in the Eastern Armenian UD treebank follows the [general guidelines](../../u/dep/index.html) but adds fifteen [language-specific relations](../hy/dep/index.html):

* [acl:relcl]() for relative clauses
* [advmod:emph]() for adverbs or particles that modify noun phrases and emphasize or negate them
* [aux:caus]() for causative auxiliaries
* [case:loc]() for postpositional localizers
* [compound:lvc]() for light compound verbs
* [compound:redup]() for reduplicated compounds
* [compound:svc]() for serial compound verbs
* [csubj:pass]() for clausal subjects of passive verbs
* [det:poss]() for possessive determiners
* [iobj:agent]() for agentive indirect objects of causative verbs
* [nmod:npmod]() for noun phrases
* [nmod:poss]() for possessive modifiers
* [nsubj:caus]() for nominal subjects of causative verbs
* [nsubj:pass]() for nominal subjects of passive verbs
* [obl:agent]() for agents of passive verbs

The following relation types are not used in Armenian at all: [clf](), [expl](), [dislocated]().

The syntactic annotation has been checked manually and corrected on a systematic basis.
