### Definition

Punctuation marks are non-alphabetical characters and character groups
used in many languages to delimit linguistic units in printed text.

Punctuation is not taken to include logograms such as _$_, _%_, and
_§_, which are instead tagged as [SYM]().

Note, that there is _infixed punctuation_ (exclamation, emphasis and question marks). We refer to such cases as _multiword tokens_, as in _ինչո՞ւ_ “why?”, which become two tokens, _<b>ինչու</b>_ and _<b>՞</b>_ (for more details see the [tokenization page](http://universaldependencies.org/hy/tokenization.html)).

### Examples

- Period: _<b>։</b>_
- Comma: _<b>,</b>_
- Parentheses: _<b>()</b>_
- Quotation mark: _<b>«»</b>_
-	Exclamation mark: _<b>՜</b>_
-	Question mark։ _<b>՞</b>_
-	Emphasis mark, Acute accent: _<b>՛</b>_
