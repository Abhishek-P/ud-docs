Person is a feature of personal and possessive
[pronouns](PRON) / [determiners](DET), and of [auxiliaries](AUX) / [verbs](VERB). On verbs it is in
fact an agreement feature that marks the person of the verb's subject. Person
marked on verbs makes it unnecessary to always add a personal pronoun
as subject and thus subjects are sometimes dropped (Armenian is a pro-drop language).

We also apply the feature [Person[psor]]() to denote the person of the possessor on nominal or pronominal elements.

### <a name="1">`1`</a>: first person

In singular, the first person refers just to the speaker / author. In
plural, it must include the speaker and one or more additional
persons.

#### Examples

* _<b>անեմ</b>&nbsp;_ “<b>I</b> do.`Sub`”
* _<b>անենք</b>&nbsp;_ “<b>we</b> do.`Sub`”

### <a name="2">`2`</a>: second person

In singular, the second person refers to the addressee of the
utterance / text. In plural, it may mean several addressees and
optionally some third persons too.

#### Examples

* _<b>անես</b>&nbsp;_ “<b>you</b>.`Sing` do.`Sub`”
* _<b>անեք</b>&nbsp;_ “<b>you</b>.`Plur` do.`Sub`”

### <a name="3">`3`</a>: third person

The third person refers to one or more persons that are neither
speakers nor addressees.

#### Examples

* _<b>անի</b>&nbsp;_ “<b>he/she/it does</b>.`Sub`”
* _<b>անեն</b>&nbsp;_ “<b>they</b> do.`Sub`”
