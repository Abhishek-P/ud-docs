The ventive is an _-a_ or _-(an)ni(m)_ morpheme that is typically attached to verbs of movement, but it may have a lexicalized meaning and appear in any finite verb. The ventive marks the direction of a situation. Currently feature takes yes/no values although RIAO data and much of MCONG data uses unary value (yes).

### <a name="Yes">`Yes`</a>: has ventive

#### Examples

* _<b>illaka</b>_ “he comes” (with the ventive)

### <a name="No">`No`</a>: does not have ventive
####Examples
* _<b>illak</b>_ “he goes” (without the ventive)
