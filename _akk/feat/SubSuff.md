Encodes the subordinative -_ni_ suffix which occurs in Neo-Assyrian alongside the subordinative -_u_ suffix. Like the subordinative -_u_ suffix, the subordinative -_ni_ suffix is attached to a verbal predicate to indicate that a clause is subordinate to the main clause. It appears after the subordinative -_u_ suffix.
