The subordinative suffix -_u_, in Neo-Assyrian mainly separable -(_ū_…)_ni_, is often also called subjunctive in Assyriological literature, although it is not mood and the same as Sub in UD. In Akkadian, the subordinative suffix is attached to a verbal predicate to indicate that a clause is subordinate to the main clause. Currently this feature takes binary values (yes/no) although the data in RIAO and much of the data in MCONG is unary (yes = has subjunctive).

### <a name="Yes">`Yes`</a>: has subordinative

#### Examples
* _<b>ipparšidūni</b>_ “(as many as/which/who) had fled”
* _<b>usbakūni</b>_ “(While) I was (in …)”
* _<b>ša šumī šaṭra ipaššiṭu-ma šumšu išaṭṭaru</b>_ “Who erases my inscribed name and writes his (own) name”

### <a name="No">`No`</a>: does not have subordinative
#### Examples
* _<b>ipparšid</b>_ “he fled”
