Mood is a feature that expresses modality and subclassifies finite
[verb](fi-pos/VERB) forms.

### <a name="Ind">`Ind`</a>: indicative

The indicative can be considered the default mood. A verb in
indicative merely states that something happens, has happened or will
happen, without adding any attitude of the speaker.

#### Examples

* _<b>idūkūšu</b>_ "They defeated him."

### <a name="Imp">`Imp`</a>: imperative

The speaker uses imperative to order or ask the addressee to do the
action of the verb.

#### Examples

* _<b>ṣalmu šuātu hulliq</b>_ "Destroy this monument!"
* _<b>šumka itti šumiya šuṭur</b>_ "Write your name with my name!"

### <a name="Prec">`Prec`</a>: precative

The precative, a polite request or encouragement, is formed with the combination of the particle _lū_ and the preterite form of a verb.

#### Examples
* _<b>līrur</b>_ “may he curse”
* _<b>luhalliqū</b>_ “may they destroy”

### <a name="Proh">`Proh`</a>: prohibitive

The prohibitive expresses negative commands and combines the negation _lā_ with the present tense. Optionally, the particle _lū_ may be added to stress the command.

#### Examples
* _<b>lā tapaššiṭ</b>_ “do not erase”
* _<b>lā tunakkar</b>_ “do not remove”
* _<b>lū lā eṣṣidi</b>_ “may he not harvest”
