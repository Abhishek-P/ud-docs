### Definition

Punctuation marks are non-alphabetical characters and character groups used to delimit linguistic units in printed text. Punctuation is not taken to include logograms such as $, %, and §, which are instead tagged as SYM.

### Examples

* . ? ! …
* , : ;
* ( ) {  [ ]
* " » « ' “ ” ’ ‘
* / _
* • * —

#### Conversion from JOS

The list of characters in ssj500k treebank has been manually divided into subgroups of `PUNCT` and [SYM](SYM). Note that some characters display characteristics of both POS categories, such as asterisk or dash-like characters that can either function as mathematical operators (`SYM`) or bullets in itemized lists (`PUNCT`). In case of such ambiguity, the more common function was chosen.
