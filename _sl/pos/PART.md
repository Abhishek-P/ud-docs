### Definition

Particles are function words that must be associated with another word or phrase to impart meaning and that do not satisfy definitions of other universal parts of speech (e.g. adpositions, coordinating conjunctions, subordinating conjunctions or auxiliary verbs).

Although the general guidelines state the PART tag should be used restrictively and only when no other tag is possible, the Slovenian treebank currently follows the JOS-based preset list of particles, among which some might also be considered as adverbs or interjections. 

The latter include feedback particles, such as _ja_ "yes" and _ne_ "no", which are currently always tagged as PART regardless whether they are used as as modal particles (_Ne motiš se._ "You are not wrong") or as fedback particles that are _not_ associated with another word or phrase (_Ne, motiš se._ "No, you are wrong.").

### Examples

- _tudi_ "also"
- _ne_ "no/not"
- _še_ "yet/more"
- _že_ "already"
- _le_ "only/just"
- _naj_ "should"
- _samo_ "only"
- _prav_ "ok/just"
- _predvsem_ "mostly"
- _sicer_ "else"
- _celo_ "even"
- _seveda_ "of course"

#### Conversion from JOS

All particles are converted to `PART`.
