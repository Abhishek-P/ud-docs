The `parataxis:restart` subtype of the [parataxis]() relation is used in spoken data for clauses
or clausal fragments that are not syntactically well connected to the previous clause because
the speaker has changed their mind and started talking about something else.

The new (restarted) clause is attached as a dependent of the earlier clause.
