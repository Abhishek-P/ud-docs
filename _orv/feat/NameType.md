Classification of named entities (token-based, no nesting of entities etc.)
The feature applies mainly to the [orv-pos/PROPN]() tag;
in multi-word foreign names, [adjectives](orv-pos/ADJ) may also have this feature
(they preserve the `ADJ` tag but at the same time they would not exist in Russian
otherwise than in the named entity).
