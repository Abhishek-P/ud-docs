This is a binary (yes/no) feature that is only annotated when its value is `Yes`. This feature is currently not used in the TOROT treebank.

Old East Slavic has a number of clitics attached to the word or written separately. Two classes of clitics are labeled in Old East Slavic treebanks, clitic auxiliaries in verb forms and clitic forms of pronouns.  

### <a name="Yes">`Yes`</a>: it is clitic

Clitic auxiliaries are typically agglutinated to a past participle or mark reflexive verbs. Etymologically they are shortened present or aorist forms of the auxiliary verb _być_ “to be” and reflexive pronoun _sebe_ “self”, respectively. Proclitics and and clitic morphemes written separately from the verb are laveled with this feature. Several clitics may be attached to the same verb.

Clitic pronouns are shortened unstressed forms of pronouns.

#### Examples

* _покланѧю<b>ти</b>сѧ_, _покланѧюти<b>сѧ</b>_ “Goodbye”, lit. “I bow to you REFL”, _не на цеме <b>сѧ</b> кормити_ “there is nothing to eat (lit. feed self)”
* _а нꙑне <b>ми</b> нь пакости_ “And now do not harm me.”
