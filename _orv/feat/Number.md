`Number` is an inflectional feature of [nouns](orv-pos/NOUN), [pronouns](orv-pos/PRON), and
other parts of speech ([adjectives](orv-pos/ADJ), [determiners](orv-pos/DET),
[verbs](orv-pos/VERB)) that mark agreement with nouns.


### <a name="Sing">`Sing`</a>: singular number

A singular noun denotes one person, animal or thing.

#### Examples

* _<b>вьсѧ новгородьскаꙗ область</b>&nbsp;_ “all Novgorod region”


### <a name="Dual">`Dual`</a>: dual number

A dual noun denotes two objects.
The dual number is attested in Old Russian and has nearly vanished from East Slavic 
by the end of the Middle Russian/Old Ukrainian/Old Belarusian period with the exception
of some fossilized expressions. As the inflectional paradigm was restructured, some dual 
endings were reused as either singular or plural endings.

#### Examples

* _<b>оба багряная стлъпа погасоста</b>&nbsp;_ “both crimson pillars went out”


### <a name="Plur">`Plur`</a>: plural number

A plural noun denotes several persons, animals or things.

#### Examples

* _<b>блг҃овѣрныи хрстїѧне</b>&nbsp;_ “faithful Christians”


### <a name="Count">`Count`</a>: count plural (adnumeral form)  

In the Middle Russian and Ruthenian, the adnumeral form is used in the construction with (mostly) paucal numerals. 
Sometimes it can be assosiated with old dual forms, sometimes - with modern genitive singular forms, and sometimes 
unique forms are used. Since the adnumeral construction calls for further investigation, all noun and adjective forms  
the use of which is governed by numerals are marked `Count`. 

#### Examples

* _<b>на обе стороне</b>&nbsp;_ “on both sides”



## Diffs

#### TOROT

`Count` is not used in the TOROT tagset.
