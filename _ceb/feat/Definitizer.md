`Definitizer=Yes` is currently used in the GJA treebank to signal the definitizer suffix. 


### <a name="Yes">`Yes`</a>: the word contains a definitizer suffix.

The definitizer suffix, in many cases, is attached to nouns precedeed by a word that is usually a demonstrative pronoun. If the noun ends with a consonant, the suffix is _-a_ (for example, _bata_ "child" to _bata<b>a</b>_). In some morphological constructions where the word ends with a vowel, _-h-_ is added before the _-a_ (for example, _libro_ "book" to _libro<b>ha</b>_). It can also be observed in adjectives in certain constructions that does not necessarily follow the demonstrative pronoun + noun rule. (for example, _gwapa_ "beautiful" to _gwapa<b>ha</b>_).

#### Examples

* _Kadtung bata<b>a</b> kay badlongon._ “That child is naughty.” (The definitizer suffix is attached to _bata_ "child", with the demonstrative pronoun _kadtu_ "that" preceding the noun, and in this example _kadtu_ has an attached linker suffix _nga_.)

* _gwapa</b>ha</b> niya oi!_ "She is so beautiful!" (The definitizer suffix attaches to _gwapa_ "beautiful").
