# UD for Umbrian <span class="flagspan"><img class="flag" src="../../flags/svg/IT-UMB.svg" /></span>

## Introduction

Umbrian is an Indo-European language of the Italic branch.
As such it shares a number of characteristics with classical IE languages and especially with Latin.
The main similarities between Umbrian and Latin are their declension and conjugation systems.
The main difference, beside phonology, is the extendisve use of cliticised postpositions in Umbrian where Latin has plain prepositions.

## Tokenization and Word Segmentation

The Iguvine tablets use a word separator to (: in the Umbrian script and â‹… in the Latin script).
We thus follow native word segmentation as much as possible.
The main exceptions are :
* when the original segmentation itself is erroneous (e.g. __pesni:mu__ for __pesnimu__ on tablet II face b);
* cliticised adpositions that we decided to separate from their host (e.g. the ubiquitous __tutaper__ is analysed as __tuta__ __per__).

## Morphology

### Tags

* `PUNCT` is not used in Umbrian (note that there are word boundaries in the original text but no sentence boundaries).

<!--
**Instruction**: Specify any unused tags. Explain what words are tagged as PART. Describe how the AUX-VERB and DET-PRON distinctions are drawn, and specify whether there are (de)verbal forms tagged as ADJ, ADV or NOUN. Include links to language-specific tag definitions if any.
-->

### Features

* `NOUN`, `PRON`, `PROPN`, `ADJ`, and `DET` are marked with `Case` and `Number`, and `Gender` when it is known.
* `VERB` is marked with `VerbForm`, and `Tense`, `Mood`, `Person`, `Number` or `Case`, `Gender`, `Number` depending on the finiteness of the form.
** Note that verbs have a future perfect form which comes from a very reduced periphrastic construction. Until we find a better solution, we decided to use `Aspect=Per` in conjunction with `Tense=Fut` for these cases. 

<!--
**Instruction**: Describe inherent and inflectional features for major word classes (at least NOUN and VERB). Describe other noteworthy features. Include links to language-specific feature definitions if any.
-->

## Syntax

* Core arguments are identified with case (`Nom` and `Acc`) and in absence of case triggering adposition (__rupinam-e__ is `obl` even if __rupinam__ is `Acc` because of the adposition __e__).

<!--
**Instruction**: Give criteria for identifying core arguments (subjects and objects), and describe the range of copula constructions in nonverbal clauses. List all subtype relations used. Include links to language-specific relations definitions if any.
