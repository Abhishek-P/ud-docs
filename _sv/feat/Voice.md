The `Voice` feature captures the distinction between active and passive for verbs ([sv-pos/VERB]() and [sv-pos/AUX]()). The value `Pass` is only used when the passive voice is realized morphologically. (Swedish in addition has a periphrastic passive similar to English: _han blev jagad_ "he was chased".)

### <a name="Act">`Act`</a>: active voice

#### Examples

* [sv] _det <b>räcker</b>_ "it suffices"
* [sv] _avdraget <b>sjunker</b>_ "the deduction drops"

### <a name="Pass">`Pass`</a>: passive voice

#### Examples

* [sv] _inkomst <b>beskattas</b>_ "income is taxed"
* [sv] _det <b>hanteras</b> fel_ "it is handled incorrectly"
