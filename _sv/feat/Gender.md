Gender is a lexical feature of nouns and an inflectional feature
of other parts of speech (adjectives, determiners) that mark agreement with
nouns.

### <a name="Com">`Com`</a>: common gender

Swedish does not distinguish masculine/feminine most of the time but does distinguish neuter vs. non-neuter (neutrum/utrum). The non-neuter is called common gender. The common gender also includes the old masculine form.

#### Examples

* [sv] _<b>en ogift mor</b>_ "an unmarried mother"
* [sv] _<b>anmälan</b> blir <b>ifylld</b>_ "the report is filled in"
* [sv] _den <b>brittiske</b> författaren_ "the British author"

### <a name="Neut">`Neut`</a>: neuter gender

Nouns and other parts of speech that are neither masculine nor feminine (grammatically).

#### Examples

* [sv] _<b>fullt bostadstillägg</b>_ "full housing supplement"
* [sv] _<b>det</b> första <b>kravet</b>_ "the first <b>requirement"
