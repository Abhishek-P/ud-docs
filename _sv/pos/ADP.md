### Definition

Adposition is a cover term for prepositions and postpositions. 

Swedish has prepositions but not postpositions (except in a few fixed archaic phrases). In Swedish, some prepositions may also function as verb particles, as in _säga <b>till</b>_ "tell" or _komma <b>åt</b>_ "get at". They are still tagged `ADP` and not [PART]().

### Examples

- _i_ "in/on"
- _på_ "of/at"
- _genom_ "through/via"
