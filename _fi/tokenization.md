# Tokenization

The tokenization of the UD Finnish treebank follows with only minor modifications the tokenization of the [Turku Dependency Treebank](http://bionlp.utu.fi/fintreebank.html) (TDT), which is a straightforward
whitespace-based tokenization with conventional separation of punctuation.
The Finnish UD treebank does not contain multiword tokens.
