In Finnish, there is no equivalent for the verb _have_.
Rather, having is expressed using the verb _olla_ (_to be_).
For instance, the meaning of the sentence _I have a pen_ would be
expressed in Finnish by _Minulla on kynä_, literally _"At me is a pen"_.
These possessive clauses are analyzed as a subtype to copula clauses,
making the owner (_minulla_, _at me_ in the previous example) the head,
while the copula verb is marked with relation **cop:own** distinguising
possessive clauses from typical copula clauses (_Minä olen ihminen_, _I am a human_)
as well as existential clauses (_Pihalla on auto_, _There is a car in the yard_).
