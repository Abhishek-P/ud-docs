Mood is a feature that expresses modality and subclassifies finite
[verb](fi-pos/VERB) forms.

### <a name="Ind">`Ind`</a>: indicative

The indicative can be considered the default mood. A verb in
indicative merely states that something happens, has happened or will
happen, without adding any attitude of the speaker.

#### Examples

* [fi] _minä <b>sanon</b>_ "I <b>say</b>"

### <a name="Imp">`Imp`</a>: imperative

The speaker uses imperative to order or ask the addressee to do the
action of the verb.

#### Examples

* [fi] _<b>kypsennä</b> uunissa_ "_<b>fry</b> in the oven_"

### <a name="Cnd">`Cnd`</a>: conditional

The conditional mood is used to express actions that would have taken
place under some circumstances but they actually did not / do not
happen.

#### Examples

* [fi] _<b>tarvistisimme</b> tilaa_ "we <b>would need</b> space"

### <a name="Pot">`Pot`</a>: potential

The action of the verb is likely but not certain.

#### Examples

* [fi] _talo <b>valmistunee</b>_ "the house <b>will likely be completed</b>"

### <a name="Opt">`Opt`</a>: optative

<!-- DZ: The following text taken from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optative_mood#Finnish -->
The Finnish optative (or second imperative) is archaic, mainly appearing in poetry,
and used in suppletion with the first imperative.
<!-- DZ: Hiding this because the -ko- morpheme cannot be observed in the example; perhaps it was assimilated by morphonological rules?
It is formed using the suffixes
_-ko-_ and _-kö-_, depending on vowel harmony, whereas the first imperative uses
the suffixes _-ka-_ and _-kä-_. -->
In Universal Dependencies, the optative occurs in the FTB data but not in TDT and PUD.

#### Examples

* [fi] _<b>kävellös</b>_ "you shall walk" (active voice 2nd person singular present optative of _kävellä_ "to walk"; the corresponding first imperative form is _kävele_)
* [fi] _<b>ällös</b> kävele_ "don't walk" (negative optative of _kävellä_ "to walk"; the corresponding first imperative form is _älä kävele_)
