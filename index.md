# <img class="logo" src="logos/logo-ud.png" width="32px"> Universal Dependencies

Universal Dependencies (UD) is a framework for consistent annotation of grammar
(parts of speech, morphological features, and syntactic dependencies) across different human languages. UD is
an open community effort with over 300 contributors producing nearly 200 treebanks in over 100 languages.
If you're new to UD, you should start by reading the first part of the Short Introduction and then browsing the annotation guidelines.

## Current UD Languages

<small>Information about language families (and genera for families with multiple branches) is mostly taken from
[WALS Online](http://wals.info) (IE = Indo-European).</small>
