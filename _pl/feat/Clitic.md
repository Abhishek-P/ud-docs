Boolean feature of [auxiliary verbs](u-pos/AUX). It tells whether the auxiliary form is a clitic
(see also the feature [Agglutination]()). Clitic auxiliaries are typically agglutinated to a past
participle (with or without a conditional clitic).

This feature is currently used in the PDB and PUD treebanks but not in LFG.

### <a name="Yes">`Yes`</a>: it is clitic

Clitic auxiliaries are shortened present forms of the auxiliary verb _być_ “to be”:
_-m, -em_ “I am”, _-ś, -eś_ “you are (Sing)”, _-śmy_ “we are”, _-ście_ “you are (Plur)”.
Note that the conditional morpheme _by_ does not get the feature although it is linguistically
a clitic, too.

#### Examples

* _Poprosili<b>śmy</b> inne kraje o pomoc_ “We have asked other countries for help”
* _Nie chciałby<b>m</b> wywierać na was presji_ “I hate to put a little pressure on you”
