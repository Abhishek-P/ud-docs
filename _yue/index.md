# UD for Cantonese <span class="flagspan"><img class="flag" src="../../flags/svg/HK.svg" /></span>

## Tokenization and Word Segmentation

* Cantonese is written using Chinese characters. Whitespaces are not used in this writing system, hence there are no orthographic words
  (except for occasional intrusion of words in Roman and other alphabets). Syntactic words (nodes in the tree structure) have been
  identified following language-internal criteria. In the CoNLL-U file, `SpaceAfter=No` is used at almost every token, including at the
  end of the sentence.

## Morphology

### Tags

This is an overview only. For more detailed discussion and examples, see the list of [Cantonese POS tags](pos/index.html).
