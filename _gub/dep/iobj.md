An indirect object is a nominal phrase which works as a core argument of the predicate but is neither a subject nor an object.

Indirect objects in Guajajara require the noun to be marked with the postposition _upe_.

~~~ sdparse
uwexakar tɨwɨr hemiʔiwàkwer izupe no \n (He) took the older brother to the one who was wounded with the arrow
iobj(uwexakar, izupe)
~~~

The indirect object can also be pronominal, in which case the possessor pronoun is incorporated to the postposition.

~~~ sdparse
Aha putar haikwer romo iʔi zekaipo izupe \n  I'll go after him, he (the older brother) said to her.
iobj(iʔi, izupe)
