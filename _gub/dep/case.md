Case marking elements are function words which assign case to the noun of which they are dependents. They are always separate syntactic words, otherwise case is marked with the morphological feature [Case](https://universaldependencies.org/u/feat/Case.html)

Case marking elements in Guajajara are always pospositions. They can be distinguished from morphological case in that they can appear with the contiguity or non-contiguity relational marker:

~~~ sdparse
ɨwɨkwar pupe \n from inside the hole
case(ɨwɨkwar, pupe)
~~~

Case marking elements with contiguity markers may sometimes be written as one word with its head. In those case, they are considered compound words and analysed as such.

```
tue-ha-r-upi
always-Nomzr-Cont-for
forever
```
