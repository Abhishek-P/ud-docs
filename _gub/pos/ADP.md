### Definition

Guajajara only has postpositions.
They occur after a complement noun phrase (or a nominal subordinate clause) and they form a single structure with the complement to express its grammatical and semantic relation to another unit within a clause.
Postpositions combine with the contiguity/non-contiguity markers indicating whether argument of the postposition is the preceding element ([Rel=Cont]()) 
or it is discontinuous or absent ([Rel=NCont]())


### Examples

- _pe=<b>∅-me</b>_ "<b>to you(pl)</b> "
- _aʔe_ <b>r-upi</b> "<b>because of that</b>"
- <b>i-z-upe</b> "<b>to him/her (absent)</b>"
