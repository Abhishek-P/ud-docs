`NFoc` refers to a construction in which and adverbial adjunct is fronted, becoming focalized. The fronting of the adverbial constituent triggers nominalization of the main predicate which, in this, case, is non-focal (NonFoc). In Tupí-Guaraní language descriptions, this construction is usually called indicative-II or oblique topicalized.


### <a name="Yes">`Yes`</a>: Yes
