The only `Tense` 



### <a name="Fut">`Fut`</a>: Future

Usually realised in adverbs

#### Examples

* _<b>oho putar</b>&nbsp;_ “He/she/they will go" 


`Past` is not a feature of the verb in Guajajara. Some evidential partiles also carry tense, as *kakwez*, 
which always appears in second position and inindicates an attested event in a distant past. 

### <a name="Past">`Past`</a>: Past

Usually realised in adverbs

#### Examples

* _<b>Ukwaw kakwez zeʔengete imungetahaw aʔe wə kurɨ</b>&nbsp;_ “They know (attested in the distant past) how to read Guajajara" 


## Diffs

### Prague Dependency Treebank

The PDT tagset does not distinguish `Ptan` from `Plur` and `Coll` from `Sing`,
therefore this distinction is not being made in the converted data.
