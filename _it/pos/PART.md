The use of `PART` is limited to possessive markers, in English names: [en] ‘s: these do not occurr in Italian.

In some languages the tag includes negation particles (e.g. [en] _not;_ [de] _nicht;_ [tr] _mu_); in Italian however such instances (e.g. _non_) are tagged as a negation 
adverb. See [ADV]().
