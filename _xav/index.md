### Person indexes

Xavante has a complicated system of indexation, using many different sets of markers. These are given in the tables below.



* Xavante has postpositions 


* Nominal Reduplication: it marks pluralilty in nouns, as in *pi-pi* ‘feetʼ. It can be monosyllabic (involving the first or the second syllable of the stem) or dissyllabic. Reduplication is associated with the feature-value `Redup`.

* Augmentative and diminutive: the diminutive morpheme is -*tin* `Dim` and the augmentative -*atʃo* `Augm`. These morphemes refer to the size of something or the expansion of an event (if it is big or not). 

VERBAL FEATURE


* Some verbs occur with the morpheme -*ka*, which is a transitivizer. This [feature](https://universaldependencies.org/u/feat/index.html) (`Trans`) takes the value YES if the when the morpheme is present.  Verbs that may or not combine with this morpheme take no overt object or require two obligatory arguments. 

* Verbal Reduplication: it assigns aspectual function in verbs, as in *ãbi-bi* ‘to pull successively.ʼ As in the nouns, it can be monosyllabic (involving the first or the second syllable of the stem) or dissyllabic. Reduplication is associated with the feature-value `Redup`.

* Nominalization: there are two productive nominalizer affixes in this language: -ap `Nmzr=Circ`and i- `Nmzr=Obj`. 


### Wh-words

Xavante wh-words are built from words such as  _wa_ 'who', _marĩ_ 'what' (man's speech), _tiha_ 'what' (woman's speech), _mamɛ_ 'where', _mahãta_ 'where is', and _momo_ 'where to'. These are, in questions, predeced by the particle _e_, which indicates that the speaker requires new information.
