Mood is a verbal feature that expresses modality and subclassifies finite
verb forms. There are four values of mood: indicative, imperative, subjunctive and potential.

### <a name="Ind">`Ind`</a>: indicative

The indicative can be considered the default mood. A verb in
indicative merely states that something happens, has happened or will
happen, without adding any attitude of the speaker.

The indicative mood includes finite forms for all three tenses
(past, present, future) and both aspects (imperfective, perfective). However, the present perfective forms,
while tagged `Mood=Ind` have subjunctive meaning. The negative particle is 

#### Examples

* h لیک **لرلم** _lik **lwalë́m**_ “I am reading the letter”
* h کور ته **به راشو** _kor ta **bë râšú**_ “we will come home”
* h ما کتاب **ونه لیکۀ‎** _mâ kitấb **wë́në likë**_ “I did not write the book”



### <a name="Imp">`Imp`</a>: imperative

The imperative mood is to express orders or requests. It does not distinguish tense. Pashto verbs have imperative forms for
the second person of both numbers, although the plural form is always identical with its indicative counterpart. The ending for the singular is ه _a_.
The affirmative imperative distinguishes both aspects, while negative imperative is used only
in imperfective aspect. The negative particle مه _má_ is stressed and is is read together with the verb (although written separately).

#### Examples

* h لیک **ولرله** _lik **wë́lwala**_ “read the letter”
* h کتاب **مه لیکئ‎** _kitấb má **likëy**_ “do not write the book”


### <a name="Sub">`Sub`</a>: subjunctive

The subjunctive mood is used in various subordinate clauses to express irreality, condition, purpose, wish etc.
It does not distinguish tense and aspect, its forms are formally present perfective, that do not have any other use on their own,
but are used to form future perfective indicative. For this reason, the subjunctive forms are usually tagged `Mood=Ind`.
The only cases, where the tag `Mood=Sub` is used, are subjective forms of irregular verbs, that are different
from the present perfective forms used to form future perfective indicative.

#### Examples


### <a name="Pot">`Pot`</a>: potential

The Pashto does not have a modal verb expressing possibility of an action, but uses the potential mood instead.
It is realized in two tenses: present and past. The potential mood can be formed in several ways: using the participle
or subjunctive of the content verb and indicative or participle of auxiliary verbs. None of these forms is tagged `Mood=Pot`.
The only case, where the tag `Mood=Pot` is used, is the word شوای _šwây_, a special form of the auxiliary verb شول _šwël_
(perfective counterpart of کېدل _kedë́l_ “to become”), which can be used in the past potential instead of past finite forms
of the verb شول _šwël_.
