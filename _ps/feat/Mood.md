Mood is a feature that expresses modality and subclassifies finite
verb forms.

### <a name="Ind">`Ind`</a>: indicative

The indicative can be considered the default mood. A verb in
indicative merely states that something happens, has happened or will
happen, without adding any attitude of the speaker.

The indicative mood includes finite forms for all three tenses
(past, present, future) and both aspects (imperfective, perfective). However, the present perfective forms,
while tagged `Mood=Ind` have subjunctive meaning.

#### Examples

* _<b>Studuješ</b> na univerzitě.&nbsp;_ “<b>You study</b> at the university.”

### <a name="Imp">`Imp`</a>: imperative

The imperative mood is to express orders or requests. Pashto verbs have imperative forms for
the second person of both numbers, altghough the plural form is always identical with its indicative counterpart.
The affirmative imperative distinguishes both aspects, while negative imperative is used only
in imperfective aspect.

#### Examples

* _<b>Studuj</b> na univerzitě!&nbsp;_ “<b>Study</b> at the university!”
* _<b>Budiž</b> světlo!&nbsp;_ “<b>Let there be</b> light!”

### <a name="Sub">`Sub`</a>: subjunctive

The subjunctive mood is used in various subordinate clauses to express irreality, condition, purpose, wish etc.
It does not distinguish tense and aspect, its forms are formally present perfective, that do not have any other use on their own,
but are used to form future perfective indicative. For this reason, the subjunctive forms are usually tagged `Mood=Ind`.
The only cases, where the tag `Mood=Sub` is used, are subjective forms of irregular verbs, that are different
from the present perfective forms used to form future perfective indicative.

#### Examples


### <a name="Pot">`Pot`</a>: potential

The Pashto does not have a modal verb expressing possibility of an action, but uses the potential mood instead.
It is realized in two tenses: present and past. The potential mood can be formed in several ways, using the participle
or subjunctive of the content verb and indicative or participle of auxiliary verbs. None of these forms is tagged `Mood=Pot`.
The only case, where the tag `Mood=Pot` is used, is the word شوای _šwây_, a special form of the auxiliary verb شول _šwël_
(perfective counterpart of کېدل _kedë́l_ “to become”), which can be used in the past potential instead of past finite forms
of the verb شول _šwël_.
