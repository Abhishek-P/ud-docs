Tense is a feature that specifies the time when the action took / takes / will take place,
in relation to the current moment or to another action in the utterance. The `tense` feature occurs with verbs ([VERB]())
and auxiliary verbs ([AUX]()).

### <a name="Pres">`Pres`</a>: present

The present tense combined with imperfective aspect `[Aspect]()=Imp`
denotes actions that are happening in the present moment
or happen repeatedly in the period spanning through the present moment.

The present tense combined with perfective aspect `[Aspect]()=Perf`
takes the role of the subjunctive mood, which is not marked, because
the forms are formally indicative and they are used also for future
perfective tense.

### <a name="Past">`Past`</a>: past

### <a name="Fut">`Fut`</a>: future
