Verb form is an inflectional feature of verbs.
There are three values of verb forms: finite, infinitive and participle.


### <a name="Fin">`Fin`</a>: finite verb

The finite verb forms are those, which have [Pers]() feature specified.
They may further inflect for all other verbal categories.

#### Examples


### <a name="Inf">`Inf`</a>: infinitive

Infinitive is an non-finite verb form that shares properties of verbs and nouns.
It is used in usually nominal positions representing
the action expressed by the verb. It is also used in compound predicates accompanied
by finite forms of non-content verbs (modal verbs, phasal verbs...), including
passive constructions with the auxiliary verb کېدل _kedë́l_ “to become”.
It behaves as a plural noun and inflects for [Case]() and [Aspect]().
Infinitive in the nominative case and imperfective aspect serves as a verbal lemma.

#### Examples


### <a name="Part">`Part`</a>: participle

Participle is a non-finite verb form that shares properties of verbs and adjectives.
It is used mainly for compound verb forms accompanied with auxiliary verbs in finite forms.
It is also used in usually adjectival positions meaning that the referent is doing or have done
the action expressed by the verb. The participle inflects mainly for [Case](), [Number]()
and [Gender](). It inflects also for [Tense]() with the `Past` and `Pres` values, but only the past
participles are used in compound verb forms; the present participles are less frequent.
The past participles have also the [Aspect]() feature tagged, but only a few verbs use also
perfective participles. Most of the verbs use only the imperfective ones.
