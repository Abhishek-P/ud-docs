Sometimes there are multiple word forms for the same lemma and set of features.
The `Variant` feature helps distinguish alternate forms.

### <a name="Long">`Long`</a>: short form of adjectives or personal pronouns

The long variant is used for perfective forms verbs کول and کېدل that have the regular prefix, although these verbs are usually used without it.

#### Examples


### <a name="Short">`Short`</a>: short form of adjectives or personal pronouns

The short variant is used for additional irregular forms of several verbs.
