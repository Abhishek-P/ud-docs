Case is an inflectional feature of nouns and infinitives
and also of adjectives, participles, some pronouns and some numerals
that mark agreement with them.
It is also valency feature of prepositions (saying that
the preposition requires its argument to be in that case).
There are four values of case: direct, oblique, ablative and vocative.

There are always at most three forms in the singular, because of shared forms.
The forms can be shared in various ways depending on the declension class:
* 1 form: DOAV
* 2 forms: DO / AV
* 2 forms: D / OAV
* 2 forms: DAV / O
* 3 forms: D / O / AV

The direct plural has either its unique form or a shared form with oblique singular
(and possibly also with other singular cases).
The obliqe, ablative and vocative cases in the plural always (except of some indeclinable borrowings)
merge into one form, different from the singular and the direct plural. This form ends in an characteristic
ending و _o_, never occurring with other forms.

Example of a noun with five different forms: تول _tol_ “weight”

### <a name="Nom">`Nom`</a>: direct

The direct case (tagged as nominative in UD) is the base form of declinable parts of speech.
It is used for subjects of non-transitive verbs or for transitive verbs is the passive voice.
Regarding active transitive verbs, it is used for subjects in non-past tenses, nouns as objects in non-past tenses
and for all objects in past tenses. Morever, it is used with most of adpositions and for nominal parts of nominal predicates
or in several other cases like temporal ranges. It serves as a lemma.

#### Examples
* ex.: **هلک** _**halë́k**_ “boy”
* ex.: **پېغله** _**péġla**_ “girl”


### <a name="Acc">`Acc`</a>: oblique

The oblique case (tagged as accusative in UD) the second most frequent morphological case.
It is used for pronominal objects in non-past tenses and for all subjects in past tenses.
It is used also with several adpositions or in fixed phrases.

#### Examples
* ex.: د **هلک** _dë **halë́k**_ “of the boy”
* ex.: د **پېغلې** _dë **péġle**_ “of the girl”

### <a name="Abl">`Abl`</a>: ablative

The ablative case (called also oblique II) is the least frequent case, sometimes not considered
a separate case at all. It has almost always the identical form with the vocative.
It is used with a few prepositions with the meaning “from” or “out of”.

#### Examples
* ex.: له **هلکه** _la **halë́ka**_ “from the boy”
* ex.: له **پېغلې** _la **péġle**_ “from the girl”

### <a name="Voc">`Voc`</a>: vocative

The vocative case is used to address someone.

Singular Formation:
* Masculine nouns ending in a consonant, take an unstressed ه _a_.
* Masculine nouns ending in ی _ay/y_, change the ending to یه _ya_.
* Feminine nouns ending in a consonant, take an unstressed ې _e_ in the vocative singular.
* Feminine nouns ending ه _a_, change it to ې _e_ in the vocative singular.
* Other nouns (both masculine and feminine) remain unchanged.

The vocative plural is identical with the oblique plural.

#### Examples
* ex.: **هلکه**، دلته راشه _**halë́ka**, dë́lta rấša_ “boy, come here”
* ex.: **پېغلې**، دلته راشه _**péġle**, dë́lta rấša_ “girl, come here”
