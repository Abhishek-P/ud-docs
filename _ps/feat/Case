Case is an inflectional feature of nouns and infinitives
and also of adjectives, participles, some pronouns and some numerals
that mark agreement with them.
It is also valency feature of prepositions (saying that
the preposition requires its argument to be in that case).
There are four values of case: direct, oblique, ablative and vocative.

### <a name="Nom">`Nom`</a>: direct

The direct case (tagged as nominative in UD) is the base form of declinable parts of speech.
It is used for subjects of non-transitive verbs or for transitive verbs is the passive voice.
For active transitive verbs, it is used also for subjects in non-past tenses, nouns as objects in non-past tenses
and for all objects in past tenses. Morever, it is used with most of adpositions and for nominal parts of nominal predicates
or in several other cases like temporal ranges. It serves as a lemma.

#### Examples

### <a name="Acc">`Acc`</a>: oblique

The oblique case (tagged as accusative in UD) the second most frequent morphological case.
It is used for pronominal objects in non-past tenses and for all subjects in past tenses.
It is used also with several adpositions or in fixed phrases.

#### Examples

### <a name="Abl">`Abl`</a>: ablative

The ablative case (called also oblique II) is the least frequent case, sometimes not considered
a separate case at all. It is used with a few prepositions with the meaning “from” or “out of”.

#### Examples

### <a name="Voc">`Voc`</a>: vocative

The vocative case is used to address someone.
