Aspect is an inflectional verbal feature describing the duration of an action in time.
There are two values of aspect: imperfective and perfective.

### <a name="Imp">`Imp`</a>: imperfective

The imperfective (or durative) aspect describes an action that happans or is happening for a period of time, e.g.
either continuous (like continuous tenses in English) or repetitive actions.
It can be used with the past, the present (i.e. an action that has begun in the past, keeps happening through
the present moment and will end in the future) or the future tense and with the imperative mood.

#### Examples
* اوس لولم _os lwalë́m_ “I am reading now”
* به تا ته هره ورځ لکم _bë tâ ta hára wraż likë́m_ “I will write you every day”


### <a name="Perf">`Perf`</a>: perfective

The perfective (or punctual) aspect describes an action understood as occurring in one moment.
It can be used only with the past and the future tense and the imperative mood,
as the present itself is a moment.
The present forms of the perfective have the meaning of the subjunctive mood.
For regular verbs, the perfective forms are created from their imperfective counterparts
using a stressed prefix و _wë́_.

#### Examples
* تۀ ما ته راغلې _të mâ ta rấġle_ “You came to me”
* به یو کتاب ولیکم _bë yaw kitấb wë́likëm_ “I will write a book”
