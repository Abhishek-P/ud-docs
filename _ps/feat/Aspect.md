Aspect is an inflectional verbal feature describing the duration of an action in time.
There are two values of aspect: imperfective and perfective.

### <a name="Imp">`Imp`</a>: imperfective

The imperfective (or durative) aspect describes an action that takes place for a period of time,
either continuous (like continuous tenses ni English) or repetitive.
It be used with the past, the present (i.e. an action that has begun in the past, keeps happening through
the present moment and will end in the future) or the future tense and with the imperative mood.

#### Examples

### <a name="Perf">`Perf`</a>: perfective

The perfective (or punctual) aspect describes an action understood as occurring in one moment.
It can be used only with the past and the future tense and the imperative mood,
as the present itself is a moment.
The present forms of the perfective have the meaning of the subjunctive mood.
For regular verbs, the perfective forms are created from their imperfective counterparts
using a stressed prefix و _wë́_.
