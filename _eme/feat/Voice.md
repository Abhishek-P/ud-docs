`Voice` indicates the relationship between the action and its participants.

### <a name="Cau">`Cau`</a>: Causative

In Tekó, the causative voice is marked with morphemes _`-bo`_/_`-okar`_/_`-ero`_. 

The direct causation morpheme _`-bo`_ (_`-mo`_, _`-mõ`_) is inserted  between the person index and the verb root and expresses that someone makes someone else perform the action described with an intransitive verb.

The morpheme _`-okar`_ (_`-kar`_ after /o/ and /u/) is inserted between the person index and the verb and indicates that someone causes someone else to perform the action on another person . It is less frequent than _`bo-`_ and has not been lexicalized.

#### Examples

* _wane idʒe a<b>mo</b>zaug&nbsp;_ “I wash it well.”
* _seg o<b>bo</b>apɨg&nbsp;_ “Poof, he sits her down.”
* _okaʔar<b>okar</b>&nbsp;_ “We had it destroyed (the restaurant).”
* _idʒeate lekol aiɲuŋ<b>okar</b>&nbsp;_ “It was I who made to establish the school.”


### <a name="SCau">`SCau`</a>: Sociative Causative

In Tekó, the sociative causative voice is marked with a morpheme _`-ero`_.It is inserted between the person index and the verb and indicates that someone makes someone else perform the action while performing it himself.

This prefix has several variations:
- the stem tends to lose the initial vowel /e/ in the 1st SG, 1st INCL, 2nd SG and 2nd PL
- /w/ is often added between indices ending in /o/ and the stem
- a tendency to nasalization before a morpheme with a nasal feature
- the reduction to _ir_-, _er_- or _r_- in certain cases of lexicalization

The morpheme _`-ero`_ combines only with intransitive verbs

#### Examples

* _zawarenam ka o<b>wero</b>nan&nbsp;_ “The dog runs with/makes the wasps run.”
* _ko zawar o<b>ero</b>ʔar tupawər&nbsp;_ “And then the dog drops the box with a toad.”
* _o<b>ero</b>kʷa baʔezaʔu&nbsp;_ “She passes with the food.”
* _a<b>ro</b>ʔa&nbsp;_ “I sleep with someone.”

## Diffs

### Prague Dependency Treebank

The PDT tagset does not distinguish `Ptan` from `Plur` and `Coll` from `Sing`,
therefore this distinction is not being made in the converted data.
