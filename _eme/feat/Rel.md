`Rel` is a morpheme that combines with lexical roots and postpositions. They signalize the 
adjacency or contiguity (Rel=Cont) and non-adjacency or non-contiguity of head and depenent, 
e.g., possessor-noun, object-postposition.

### <a name="Cont">`Cont`</a>: contiguous

The relational of conitguity signalizes the adjacency of the head and its dependent. There are many hints which indicate that this grammatical feature is loosing its function in Tekó.
In Tekó, `Cont` is expressed with a morpheme _`re-`_ (used before a word with an initial consonant and before a word beginning with the vowel /i/), _`n-`_ (in front of the roots that carry the nasal feature), _`r-`_ (in the rest of the cases).

#### Examples

* _awakʷəraraʔɨr okero oiba<b>r</b>ehe_&nbsp; “The little boy sleeps with his pet.”
* _de<b>re</b>ibawesipo eremenõɲ ?_&nbsp; “Are you really sleeping with your beast?”

### <a name="NCont">`NCont`</a>: non-contiguous

Non-contiguity indicates that the dependen't does not immediately precedes the head.
