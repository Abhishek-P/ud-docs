The feature `Accomp` expresses an anteriority in relation to a temporal marker, which is not necessarily the moment of the utterance. It is marked with a particle _`-ra`_. Perhaps this particle also marks a perfect aspect.

### <a name="Yes">`Yes`</a>: Yes


#### Examples

* _aipote , idʒe<b>ra</b>&nbsp;we am tam aiɲuŋeʔe_ “And now, I have resettled a dwelling here too.” 




## Diffs

### Prague Dependency Treebank

The PDT tagset does not distinguish `Ptan` from `Plur` and `Coll` from `Sing`,
therefore this distinction is not being made in the converted data.
