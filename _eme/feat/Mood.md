`Mood` is used to signal modality.

### <a name="Des">`Des`</a>: Desiderative

The desiderative mood is expressed with a suffix _`-tanẽ`_, which is a grammaticalization of the verb _potar_ 'to want', probably followed by the particle _-nẽ_.

#### Examples

* _erezaug<b>tanẽ</b>po ?_&nbsp; “Do you want to take a bath?”

### <a name="Per">`Per`</a>: Permissive

The permissive mood is marked with a prefix _`t-`_/_`ta-`_/_`te-`_. 

#### Examples

* _awurtar aho <b>t</b>apoʔo ɨŋam_&nbsp; “I'm going upstairs to pick a sweet pea.”
* _wane <b>te</b>pedʒapɨakaõwã wɨrakarakotɨ_&nbsp; “You have to think a little about God.”

### <a name="Imp">`Imp`</a>: Imperative

`Imp` is a mood expressing an order given to one or more interlocutors. In Teko, it is marked with a prefix _`e-`_ (2nd person singular) and _`pe-`_ (2nd person plural).

#### Examples

* _<b>e</b>kʷa wɨtʃɨ_&nbsp; “Go away.”
* _<b>pe</b>koar tapɨdʒam taike_&nbsp; “Find me a home for me to come back.”

### <a name="Irr">`Irr`</a>: Irrealis

`Irr` is marked with suffixes _`itʃe-`_(_`ite-`_)/_`kuwa-`_. 

#### Examples

* _koba<b>itʃe</b> tarawadʒanam , dapɨhɨgi maire_&nbsp; “And if there was work, I would not take the post of mayor.”
* _wane<b>kuwa</b> am zatarawadʒ_&nbsp; “It would be nice if we worked here.”

### <a name="Dub">`Dub`</a>: Dubitative

`Dub` indicates if the statement is dubious. It is marked with a particle _`-enã`_. 

#### Examples

* _kʷi<b>enã</b> oronekomuwe perupi orohotaruwe_&nbsp; “One day, perhaps, we will go there.”

### <a name="Jus">`Jus`</a>: Jussive

`Jus` is a directive mood that expreses ordering, commanding, or exhorting. In Tekó, it is marked with _`-ko`_ (appears together with imperative particles) , _`-nane`_ (appears together with permissive particles), _`-na`_ (with both imperative and permissive particles). 

#### Examples

* _derapɨdʒ<b>nane</b> _&nbsp; “Have a house then.”

## Diffs

### Prague Dependency Treebank

The PDT tagset does not distinguish `Ptan` from `Plur` and `Coll` from `Sing`,
therefore this distinction is not being made in the converted data.
