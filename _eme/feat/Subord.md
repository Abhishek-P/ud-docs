In Tekó, `Subord` is marked with suffixes _`-nam`_/_`-nawe`_/_`-nate`_/_`-zepe`_. 

_`-Nam`_/_`-nawe`_/_`-nate`_ introduces temporal clauses, while the subordinate _`-nate`_ seems to express a specific time. Additionally, the subordinate _`-nam`_ (sometimes_`-na`_) marks conditional clauses and is often used with the irrealis particle _-itʃe_.

The concessive particle _`-zepe`_/_`-epe`_ indicates that the propositional content contrasts with what is described in the main clause.

### <a name="Yes">`Yes`</a>: Yes


#### Examples

* _en92a<b>nam</b> , Polorekojaram adʒu_&nbsp; “In 92, I became Paulo's replacement.”
* _nanipamẽitʃe zadʒapɨaka<b>nam</b>..._&nbsp; “If everyone thought so...”
* _10heuresaʔe<b>nawe</b> oker_&nbsp; “At 10, they went to sleep.”
* _munuʔaŋa<b>nate</b> ohẽhem ohoŋ_&nbsp; “In the afternoon, they leave.”
* _sidʒeminanã<b>zepe</b> omãʔẽnẽ nõderehe_&nbsp; “Even if we hide, he still sees us.”

## Diffs

### Prague Dependency Treebank

The PDT tagset does not distinguish `Ptan` from `Plur` and `Coll` from `Sing`,
therefore this distinction is not being made in the converted data.
