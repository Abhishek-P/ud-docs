`Imprs` indicates a general human referent. In Tekó, it can be expressed with _`za-` (as an index of the Series I), _`zo-`_/_`poro-`_  (as an index of the Series II). In many texts, _`za-` refers to the whole Emerillon community. _`Zo-`_ is used as an object of postposition and as a possessor, which can often be translated as "the people", while /_`poro-`_ is used as an object of the verb.

## Diffs

### Prague Dependency Treebank

The PDT tagset does not distinguish `Ptan` from `Plur` and `Coll` from `Sing`,
therefore this distinction is not being made in the converted data.
