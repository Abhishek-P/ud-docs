`Corf` indicates that two or more expressions refer to the same person or thing and have the same referent. In Tekó, it is marked with the prefix _`o-`_, which is used only if the subject is in 3rd person. In the sentence, the prefix _`o-`_ can occur as a possessive person index on a noun and as an object of postposition.

### <a name="Yes">`Yes`</a>: Yes


#### Examples

* _<b>o</b>paʔawo iawu_&nbsp; “<b>He</b> talks like <b>his own</b> brother.”
* _ka omõwaɲ zawar <b>o</b>ehe_&nbsp; “The dog scatters the wasps on itself.”

## Diffs

### Prague Dependency Treebank

The PDT tagset does not distinguish `Ptan` from `Plur` and `Coll` from `Sing`,
therefore this distinction is not being made in the converted data.
