The adverbial nominalizer is marked in Tekó with suffixes _`-(e)war`_/_`-wan`_. It is often used to express the origin or place of being of an individual, or the usual location of a thing. It attaches to a demonstrative adverb or a postpositional group.

## Diffs

### Prague Dependency Treebank

The PDT tagset does not distinguish `Ptan` from `Plur` and `Coll` from `Sing`,
therefore this distinction is not being made in the converted data.
