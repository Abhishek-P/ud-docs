### Definition

A numeral is a word, functioning most typically as a determiner,
adjective or pronoun, that expresses a number and a relation to the
number, such as quantity, sequence, frequency or fraction.

Note that cardinal numerals are covered by NUM whether they are expressed as words (four), digits (4) or Roman numerals (IV).

In Tatar, numbers may get features [NumType](tt-feat/NumType)`=Card= (cardinal)`, `Numtype=Ord` (ordinal), `NumType=Dist` (distributive), and `NumType=Sets` (collective), through suffixation.

We also mark interrogative _ничә_ "how many" as `NUM`.

### Examples

- _0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 2014, 1000000, 3,14159265359_ 
- _I, II, III, IV, V, MMXIV_
- _бер_ "one", _биш_ "five", _унбиш_ "fifteen"
- _ничә_ "how many", _ничәнче_ "which one (of an ordered entities)", _ничәр_ "how many each", _ничәү_ "how many (of)"
