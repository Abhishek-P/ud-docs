### Definition

Tatar only has postpositions.
They occur after a complement noun phrase (or a nominal subordinate clause) and they form a single structure with the complement to express its grammatical and semantic relation to another unit within a clause.

A number of postpositions in Turkish are complex,
derived from a closed set of nouns (see Göksel & Kerslake 2005, ch.17).
Adpositions include _турында_ or _турыда_ and _буенча_, which are combinations of a noun(, a possessive suffix,) and a case suffix,
as they are rather grammaticalized into a fixed form;
for example, _минем тур-ын-да_ (or _минем тур-ы-да) "about me" is a correct phrase
while _минем тур-ым-да_ (with the 1st person possessive agreement) is not.
This category does not include ungrammaticalized counterparts such as 
_аст-ын-да_ "below", _арка-сын-да_ "behind", _ярдәм-ен-дә_ "thanks to", unlike Turkish UD.
These pseudo-postposition expressions allow grammatical agreements with the preceding NP,
for example _сезнең ярдәм-егез-дә_ "thanks to you (pl.)" (with the 2nd person plural possessive suffix).
These are marked as `NOUN`, whose morphological information is to be described in detail in the `FEAT` column.
(**TODO**: this requires discussion).

### Examples

- _сәгать өчкә <b>кадәр</b>_ "<b>until</b> eight o'clock"
- _Марат <b>өчен</b>_ "for Marat"
- _Мараттан <b>тыш</b>_ "except Marat"
