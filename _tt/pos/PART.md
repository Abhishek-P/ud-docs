### Definition

Particles are function words that must be associated with another word
or phrase to impart meaning and that do not satisfy definitions of
other universal parts of speech.

PART is currently not used in Tatar.
In some languages like Turkish, negative particles for non-verbal predicates (e.g., _değil_ in Turkish) may be tagged with PART,
but in Tatar _түгел_ "not" is tagged as AUX with DEPREL to its head as aux.
