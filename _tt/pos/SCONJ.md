### Definition

A subordinating conjunction is a conjunction that links constructions by making one of them a constituent of the other. 
The subordinating conjunction typically marks the incorporated constituent which has the status of a (subordinate) clause.

In Tatar, subordinate clauses are mainly formed by suffixation.
However, there are a few words that form subordinate clauses such as _дип_, _чөнки_, and _әгәр_.

For _coordinating conjunctions,_ see [CCONJ]().

### Examples

- _Килмәячәк <b>дип</b> беләм_ "I know <b>that</b> he will not come"
- _<b>Әгәр</b> килмәсәң миңа әйт_ "If you are not coming, let me know".
