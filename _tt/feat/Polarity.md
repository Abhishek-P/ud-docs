In Tatar [verbs](tt-pos/VERB) are negated with the suffix _-ма/мә_ (and its allomorphs).
Only exception is the particle _түгел_ which functions as an auxiliary or copula
(it is the main means of negating a copular clause, but it can also be used to negate a verbal clause).
_түгел_ is marked as `Negative=Neg` when it is used as a copula or auxiliary.

We (currently) do not mark adjectives for the `Polarity` feature.

### <a name="Pos">`Pos`</a>: positive, affirmative

#### Examples

- _укыячак_ "he/she will read"
- _Марат доктор_ "Marat is a doctor"

### <a name="Neg">`Neg`</a>: negative

#### Examples

- _Укы<b>ма</b>ячак_ "he/she will not read"
- _Марат доктор <b>түгел</b>_ "Marat is not a doctor"
