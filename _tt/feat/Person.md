In Tatar, `Person` is a feature of personal [pronouns](tt-pos/PRON), and [verbs](tt-pos/VERB).
`Person` marking on verbs are obligatory in Tatar for all finite verb forms.
The `Person` marker on predicates agrees with the grammatical person of the subject.

We do not mark [nouns](tt-pos/NOUN) for `Person`.

### <a name="1">`1`</a>: first person

In singular, the first person refers just to the speaker / author. In
plural, it must include the speaker and one or more additional
persons.

It is used for pronouns *мин* 'I' and *без* 'we' and their inflected forms, and verbs with a first person plural/singular agreement suffix.

#### Examples

* *<b>мин</b>* "I"
* *<b>мин</b>ем* "my"
* *<b>без</b>неке* "the one that belongs to us, ours"
* *(мин) укыды<b>м</b>* "I read (Past)" -- note the optionality of the subject
* *(без) укыячак<b>быз</b>* "We will read"


### <a name="2">`2`</a>: second person

In singular, the second person refers to the addressee of the
utterance / text. In plural, it may mean several addressees and
optionally some third persons too.

It is used for pronouns *син* 'you (Sing)' and *сез* 'you (Plur)' and their inflected forms, and verbs with a second person  plural/singular agreement suffix.

The second person singular agreement suffix is null for verbs in imperative form.

#### Examples

* *<b>син</b>е* "you" `Case=Acc|Number=Sing|Person=2`
* *<b>син</b>нән* "from you" `Case=Abl|Number=Sing|Person=2`
* *<b>сез</b>дә* "on you, in you" `Case=Loc|Number=Plur|Person=2`
* *укы!* "read it!" `Mood=Imp|Number=Sing|Person=2`
* *укыды<b>ң</b>* "you (sg.) read" `Number=Sing|Person=2|Tense=Past|VerbForm=Fin`
* *укыячак<b>сыз</b>* "you (pl.) will read" `Mood=Ind|Number=Plur|Person=2|Tense=Fut|VerbForm=Part`


### <a name="3">`3`</a>: third person

The third person refers to one or more persons that are neither
speakers nor addressees.

It is used for pronouns *o* 'he/she/it' and *onlar* 'they' and their inflected forms, and verbs with a second third plural/singular agreement suffix. The third person singular agreement suffix is null in most cases.

#### Examples

* *<b>аңа</b>* "to him/her/it" `Case=Dat|Number=Sing|Person=3`
* *<b>алар</b>га* "to them" `Case=Dat|Number=Plur|Person=3`
* *укыды* "he/she read" `Number=Sing|Person=3|Tense=Past|VerbForm=Fin`
* *укыды(<b>лар</b>)* "they read" `Number=Plur|Person=3|Tense=Past|VerbForm=Fin` -- note the optionality of the  agreement on the verb
