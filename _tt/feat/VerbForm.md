The feature `VerbForm` can be used for verbal or deverbal elements in matrix and embedded clauses.
As of now, the Tatar treebank makes use of  `Conv`, `Fin`, `Part`, and `Vnoun`.


### <a name="Conv">`Conv`</a>: converb

The converb, also called transgressive or adverbial participle,
is a non-finite verb form that shares properties of verbs and adverbs.
Different converbs of Tatar are distinguished by their aspect value.
Converb also includes a conditional form *-са/сә*, with the specification of `Mood=Cnd`, like Kazakh UD, although Turkish UD considers this form as a finite verb (cf. rule of thumb: if the verb and all of its dependents can be uttered alone without a conversational context, the verb should be finite).
(**TODO:** this needs more discussion)

#### Examples

- _Ул <b>язып</b> утыра_ "He is sitting and writing" (this form does not entail any aspectual feature)
- _Мин <b>сөйли-сөйли</b> <b>арып</b> беттем._ "I’m tired of speaking" `Aspect=Prog|VerbForm=Conv`
- _Яңгыр <b>туктагач</b>, барырбыз_ "We will go after the rain stops" `Aspect=Perf|VerbForm=Conv`
- _Әти <b>килгәнче</b>, озак көттем_ "I had waited long till my father came" `Aspect=Imp|VerbForm=Conv`
- _Казанга <b>барсак</b>, тарихи урыннарны карарбыз_ "If we go to Kazan, we will visit historical places" `Mood=Cnd|VerbForm=Conv`

### <a name="Fin">`Fin`</a>: finite verb

Verbs that are marked for mood ([Mood]()), tense ([Tense]()) or
person ([Person]()) are finite and are assigned the `VerbForm` value `Fin`.
Either embedded or matrix verbs can be finite.
Rule of thumb: If the verb and all of its dependents can be uttered alone without a conversational context, the verb should be finite.

#### Examples

- _Өйгә <b>кайтты</b>._ "He/She came home."

### <a name="Part">`Part`</a>: participle

Participle is a non-finite verb form which functions like an adjective.
The participles are introduced using a number of subordinating suffixes.

Tatar has past participle, present participle, and future participle.
There are three forms of future participle, *-ачак/әчәк*, *-асы/әсе*, and *-ыр/ер*, which have a slight difference in `Mood`.
Present participle *-учы/үче* usually modifies a noun denoting its agent, typically a person, and often stands by itself without its head to mean Nomen Agensis (like English *-er* in *writer*)

#### Examples

- _мин <b>укыячак</b> китап_ "the book that I will read"
- _Марат <b>укыган</b> китап_ "the book that Marat read"
- _китап <b>укучы</b> кеше_ "the person reading a book"
- _<b>укучы</b>_ "student, pupil" (lit. "the one who reads")

### <a name="Vnoun">`Vnoun`</a>: verbal noun

Verbal nouns are derived from verbs. 
In Tatar, verbal nouns are formed by the suffix *-у/ү*.

#### Examples

- _бар<b>у</b>_ "to go, going, the act of going"

### <a name="Inf">`Inf`</a>: infinitive

Infinitive is a non-finite verb form that may be used together with auxiliaries or verbs to entail additional modal, aspectual, etc. meaning.

Tatar infinitive is marked by the suffix *-ырга/ергә*.

#### Examples

- _бар<b>ырга</b> кирәк "it is necessary to go"

### <a name="NomAg">`NomAg`</a>: Nomen Agensis
The Nomen Agensis is derived from a verb with an agent or performer, and it represents the nominalization of the subject.
This feature is also used in Komi Zyrian UD.
It can also modify an animate noun which is the agent of the verb.

#### Examples

- _бар<b>учы</b> кеше "the person who is going", "going person"
- _бар<b>учы</b> "the one who goes
