Degree of comparison is typically an inflectional feature of some
[adjectives](u-pos/ADJ) and [adverbs](u-pos/ADV).

Most [nouns](u-pos/NOUN) and [proper names](u-pos/PROPN) in Afrikaans can be diminutivized,
and the `Degree` feature is also used to mark diminutives of nouns.



### <a name="Dim">`Dim`</a>: diminutive form

A diminutive form is labelled as such; as its lemma, the non-diminutive form is given.

#### Examples

* _Tree vir tree sal ons dit maak, soos die spreekwoord lui, landsgenote, groot dinge begin met klein <b>treetjies</b>._ “We will do this step by step, as the proverb says, big things start with little steps.”

### <a name="Pos">`Pos`</a>: positive, first degree

This is the base form that merely states a quality of something,
without comparing it to qualities of others. Note that although this
degree is traditionally called "positive", negative properties can be
compared, too.

#### Examples

* _die <b>internasionale</b> gemeenskap_ “the international community”

### <a name="Cmp">`Cmp`</a>: comparative, second degree

The quality of one object is compared to the same quality of another
object.

#### Examples

* _Dit word toenemend <b>sterker</b>._ “It gets increasingly strong.”

### <a name="Sup">`Sup`</a>: superlative, third degree

The quality of one object is compared to the same quality of all other
objects within a set.

#### Examples

* _Ons sal ons pogings verskerp, geïnspireer deur die entoesiasme, hoop en veerkragtigheid van die Suid-Afrikaanse mense in 'n strewe na dit wat die <b>beste</b> is vir ons almal._ “We will intensify our attempts, inspired by the enthusiasm, hope and resilience of the South African people in pursuit of what is best for all of us.”
