Compounds are traditionally segmented to individual syntactic words in
Sanskrit, although they are written as one orthographical word. Only the last
part of a nominal compound bears the case ending. The previous parts have
a case-neutral form (which is often identical to singular vocative).
These forms are tagged with `Compound=Yes`.

### <a name="Yes">`Yes`</a>: it is a case-less form in a compound

#### Examples

* एवञ्च ततो <b>धर्मार्थ</b>कामशास्त्राणि ज्ञायन्ते। / _evañca tato <b>dharmārtha</b>kāmaśāstrāṇi jñāyante._ “And this way <b>Dharma</b>, <b>Artha</b> and Kamashastra are known.” (The compound has three parts. <b>धर्म</b> / _<b>dharma</b>_ and <b>अर्थ</b> / _<b>artha</b>_ are caseless and tagged `Compound=Yes`. The last part, कामशास्त्राणि / _kāmaśāstrāṇi_ bears the suffix expressing neuter plural accusative. It is tagged with gender, number and case, but not with `Compound=Yes`.)
