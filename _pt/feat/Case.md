`Case` is usually an inflectional feature of [nouns](u-pos/NOUN) and,
depending on language, other parts of speech ([pronouns](pt-pos/PRON),
[adjectives](u-pos/ADJ), [determiners](u-pos/DET), [numerals](u-pos/NUM),
[verbs](u-pos/VERB)) that mark agreement with nouns. In some tagsets
it is also valency feature of [adpositions](u-pos/ADP) (saying that
the adposition requires its argument to be in that case).

Case helps specify the role of the noun phrase in the sentence,
especially in free-word-order languages. For example, the nominative
and accusative cases often distinguish subject and object of the verb,
while in fixed-word-order languages these functions would be
distinguished merely by the positions of the nouns in the sentence.

Since Portuguese is not a free-word-order language, `case` is used only to describe ([pronouns](pt-pos/PRON) that inherited this feature from Latin.

We have three cases in Portuguese: nominative (`Nom`), dative (`Dat`) and accusative (`Acc`).

### <a name="Nom">`Nom`</a>: nominative / direct

#### Examples

* _eu, ele, você, tu, nós_

### <a name="Acc">`Acc`</a>: accusative / oblique

#### Examples

* _lo_ in _visando dotá-<b>lo</b> de poderes_ “aiming to empower him”
* _se_ in _a copa que amanhã <b>se</b> disputa_ “the cup that will be played tomorrow”

### <a name="Dat">`Dat`</a>: dative

#### Examples

* _lhe, lhes_ in _políticas que <b>lhes</b> dizem respeito_ “policies that concern them”
