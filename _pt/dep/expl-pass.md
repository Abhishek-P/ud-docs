Some languages, as Portuguese, do not have expletives of the English sort, including most languages
with free pro-drop (the ability to use zero anaphora rather than overt pronouns). In languages with
expletives of this sort, they can be positioned where normally a core argument appears: the subject
and direct object (and even indirect object) slots, as in the examples below.
