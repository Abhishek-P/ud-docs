Like [prearticulated adjectives](det-adj.html), some nouns are also prearticulated
and we use the relation `det:noun` to attach the article to the noun. Note that if a noun occurs
with an article that signifies a genitive construction, the article will be attached via plain
`det` relation. However, a nominalized adjective has an article that is attached as `det:noun`
(note that in the example below, _të vdekurit_ “the dead” is in accusative rather than genitive).
