Noun type is a lexical feature of selected nouns. Other nouns omit the feature, which means that
they do not have any unusual properties.

### <a name="Het">`Het`</a>: heterogenous

Heterogenous nouns change gender in plural. They are usually words that are masculine in singular
and use the feminine _-e_ suffix in plural.

#### Examples

* _ishulli ishte <b>vend</b> kelt_ “the island was Celtic country” `Gender=Masc|NounType=Het|Number=Sing`
* _në <b>vendet</b>_ “in places” `Gender=Fem|NounType=Het|Number=Plur`
