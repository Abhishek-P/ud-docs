Noun type is a lexical feature of selected nouns. Other nouns omit the feature, which means that
they do not have any unusual properties.

### <a name="Het">`Het`</a>: heterogenous

Heterogenous nouns change gender in plural. They are usually words that are masculine in singular
and use the feminine _-e_ suffix in plural.
