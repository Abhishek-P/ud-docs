A preconjunct is the relation between the head of a nominal and a word that appears at the beginning bracketing a conjunction (and puts emphasis on it). This relation applies only to <b>both</b>, <b>either</b>, and <b>neither</b> in their correlative uses (*both...and*, *either...or*, *neither...nor*).

~~~ sdparse
Both the cat and the dog are here
cc:preconj(cat, Both)
~~~

The words <b>both</b>, <b>either</b>, and <b>neither</b> may also be (pre)determiners, but they are not functioning as such in this construction: note that the above sentence does not entail \**Both the cat is here*.
