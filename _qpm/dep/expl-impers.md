The relation <code>expl:impers</code> is a sub-class of <code>expl</code>. It is applied on the impersonal use of the reflective pronoun _só_, _sí_, _sé_ specifically. There may be an impersonal construction for every verb, both transitive and intransitive, where the role of the subject is played by the pronoun itself in terms of significance, but it is predominantly expressed by another clausal subject: 

~~~ sdparse
dúmi só óti  si našól líry 
said it that he found golden.sovereigns
`it is said  that he has found golden.sovereigns'
           
expl:impers(dúmi, só)
csubj(dúmi, našól)
~~~
