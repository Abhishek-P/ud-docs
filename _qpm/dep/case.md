The [case]() dependency is used for any case-marking element which is treated as a separate syntactic word (including prepositions, 
postpositions, and clitic case markers). Case-marking elements are treated as dependents of the noun they attach to or introduce.
In several morphological rich languages, a nominal in an oblique case will receive the same dependency structure as a nominal introduced by an adposition.

In the Pomak treebank, [case]() is predominantly used to mark an accusative case introduced by a preposition (morphologically labeled as ADP):
