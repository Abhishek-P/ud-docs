The `compound` relation is one of three relations for multiword expressions (MWEs) (the other two being `fixed` and `flat`).

In the Pomak treebank, the [compound]() relation has been used for a particular type of noun-adjective formation. Τhe morphosyntactic criterion is that the adjective follows the noun and forms a unit with it since the enclitic definite determiner is attached to the adjective.
