The [compound]() dependency is applied to any kind of X0 compounding: noun compounds (e.g., phone book), but also verb and adjective compounds. 
Note that [compound]() is not used to link an inherently reflexive verb with the reflexive morpheme (which in Pomak is marked as 'expl:pv'):

~~~ sdparse
jirmí bin  
twenty thousands
compound(jirmí, bin)
~~~
