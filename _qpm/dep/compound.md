The `compound` relation is one of three relations for multiword expressions (MWEs) (the other two being `fixed` and `flat`). 
Each language that uses `compound` should develop its own specific criteria based on morphosyntax (rather than lexicalization or semantic idiomaticity),
though elsewhere the terms "compound" and "multiword expression" may be used more broadly.

In the Pomak treebank it has been used for a particular type of noun-adjective formation:

~~~sdparse
Hamdí-star
lit. Hamdi-old
"old Hamdi"
compound(Hamdí, star)
punct(Hamdí, -)
~~~
