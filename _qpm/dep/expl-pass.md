The relation [expl:pass]() (passive verbs) is a sub-type of the relation [expl](). It is used specifically with reflexive pronouns attached to transitive verbs
and act as a passive or mediopassive voice marker:

~~~sdparse
prebrajího só   vrit réhyse    faf Ksánti
counted    REFL all  votes-the in  Xanthi
`All the votes were counted in Xanthi.'  
   
expl:pass (prebrajího, só)
~~~
