This relation captures expletive or pleonastic nominals. 

A second, related, use of the `expl` relation is for cases of true clitic doubling.  
For languages in which clitics and lexical nominals are usually in complementary distribution – languages, 
such as French, which obey "Kayne's generalization" – then whichever of a clitic or a lexical nominal occurs will get the appropriate role, 
such as [obj]() or [iobj](). In such languages, when doubling does occur, such as in spoken French, the right analysis is to regard the lexical nominal 
as [dislocated]() (see the examples there). As such, the analysis will be the same as when a noun phrase doubles another noun phrase or a regular pronoun 
that fills a nominal argument position. However, other languages, such as Greek and Bulgarian, standardly allow doubling of a lexical nominal 
and a pronominal clitic, with the former still appearing in its regular role as an argument of the predicate. In these cases, if only one of the lexical nominal 
and the clitic appear in a clause, then whichever appears will be given the grammatical role of [obj](), [iobj](), etc. – parallel to the treatment of 
lexical nominals and pronouns in other languages, modulo the clitic pronoun having a different position in the sentence.  However, if both occur, 
the lexical nominal will be given the grammatical role of [obj](), [iobj](), etc., and the clitic will be treated as a pronominal copy, 
which does not receive its own semantic role, and hence will get the role `expl`. Modulo the different word order, this is fairly parallel 
to the treatment of _it_ and _there_ in English mentioned above, where another phrase satisfies the semantic role of the predicate. 
Examples from Greek and Pomak follow:

UD recognizes several functions of reflexive pronouns (clitics) that are usually distinguished with the help of subtypes
of the `expl` relation (see also the report from the [2015 Uppsala discussion of clitics](/workgroups/2015-08-23-uppsala/clitics.html) where
this approach was approved):

* [expl:pv]() for reflexive clitics attached to inherently reflexive verbs (also called pronominal verbs in some grammars)
* [expl:pass]() for reflexive clitics attached to transitive verbs and acting as a voice marker (passive or mediopassive)
* [expl:impers]() for impersonal usage (works also with intransitive verbs)
