A marker is the word marking a clause as subordinate to
another clause. For a [complement clause](ccomp), this is words like [en] _that_
or _whether._ For an [adverbial clause](advcl), the marker is typically a
[subordinating conjunction](../pos/SCONJ) like [en] _while_ or _although._ The marker is a dependent of the
subordinate clause head. In a [relative clause](../overview/complex-syntax.html), it is a normally uninflected word, which simply introduces a relative clause, such as [he] _še_. (In this last use, one needs to distinguish between relative clause markers, which are `mark`, from relative pronouns such as [en] _who_ or _that_, which fill a regular verbal argument or modifier grammatical relation.)
