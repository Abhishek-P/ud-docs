Reflexive pronouns (see the feature [cs-feat/Reflex]()) usually replace objects of verbs.
However, some verbs are inherently reflexive, i.e. the verb always occurs with a reflexive
prounoun, and the pronoun cannot be replaced by a non-reflexive pronoun. With these verbs, the reflexive pronoun is attached as `expl:pv` instead of `obj'.
In Pomak the relation occurs both in intransitive as well as certain transitive verbs, using one of the reflexive pronouns *so, sa, se, si, su*:
