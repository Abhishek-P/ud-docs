The [nummod]() dependency (numeric modifier of a noun) is any number phrase that serves to modify the meaning of a noun that denotes a quantity. Note that indefinite quantifiers such as few, many are assigned the PoS [DET]() rather than [NUM]():

~~~ sdparse
faf tóga so našlíli tri kompjúter 
lit: on him were found three computers   
"they found three computers on him" 
nummod(kompjúter, tri) 
~~~
