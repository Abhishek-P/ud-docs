In the Pomak treebank, the [aux:pass]() (auxialiary passive) dependency connects the auxiliary verb *som* "I am" with the verb head of the clause when the former is used to construct the periphrastic passive voice, in any tense:

~~~ sdparse
prebrajího so vrit réhyse faf Ksánti 
lit: were counted all votes-the in Xanthi
"all  votes were counted in Xanthi" 
aux:pass (prebrajího, so)
~~~
