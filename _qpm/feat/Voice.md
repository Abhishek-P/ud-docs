## Voice

For Indo-European speakers, voice means mainly the active-(medio)-passive distinction. In other languages, other shades of verb meaning are categorized as voice.
In Pomak all verb forms are marked by the `Voice=Act` feature except for those of the passive participles, which use the `Voice=Pass` feature.

### <a name="Act">`Act`</a>: active voice

The subject of the verb is the doer of the action (agent), the object is affected by the action (patient).

#### Examples

* _<b>acístihme</b> mǽstoto i <b>zagradíhme</b> go_ "we cleaned up the field and fenced it" 
* _dečjáta <b>so najédaho</b> i zlézaho navón da <b>igrót</b>_ "the children have eaten and gone out to play" 
* _<b>čúdem so</b> kak móža da stáne pó koláj inázi rábata_ "I am thinking about how that job can be done more easily" 
* _<b>slúšyj</b> kaná še tí <b>kážom</b>_ "listen to what I have to tell you"  
* _atkócaho mi só rakýse vódo <b>nóseva</b>_ "my hands have been cut off carrying water" 
* _<b>cóntiti cóntiti</b> sas itózek sáza mi razbí glavóso_ "with all this drin and drin of that saz (musical instrument) of yours you have given me a headache" 

### <a name="Pass">`Pass`</a>: passive voice

The subject of the verb is affected by the action (patient). The doer (agent) is either unexpressed or appears as an object of the verb.

#### Examples

* _tomofílen je <b>udrít</b> at stranóno_ "the car is crashed from asides" 
* _játoso je <b>svaréno</b> i žýjen íšte móža da sí sýpe da jedé_ "the food is cooked (ready) and whoever wants may serve themselves and eat" 
* _kóštana je <b>gradéna</b> 20 godíny napréš_ "the house was built 20 years ago" 
* _cvetjéno je <b>avénato</b> i íšte zalívaņe_ "the flowers are wilted and need watering"
