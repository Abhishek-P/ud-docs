## Poss

Boolean feature of pronouns, determiners or adjectives.  It specifies a word as possessive or not possessive.

While many tagsets would have "possessive" as one of the various pronoun types, this feature has been intentionally kept separate from [PronType](PronType.html), 
as it is orthogonal to pronominal types. Several of the pronominal types can be optionally possessive, and adjectives can too.


### <a name="Yes">`Yes`</a>: it is possessive

In Pomak, the feature 'Poss=Yes is assigned to some pronoun types.

Note that there is no `No` value. If the word is not possessive, the `Poss` feature will just not be mentioned in the `FEAT` column:
 the empty value has the `No` meaning.

#### Examples [qpm]


* possessive personal pronouns:
    * _moj, tvoj, tógov / tógav, tójin, naš, vаš, tǽhan_ "mine, yours, his / hers /its, our, yours, their"  
* possesive interrogative pronouns:
    * _číjje_ "who's ?"  
* possesive relative pronouns:
