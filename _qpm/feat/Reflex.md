## Reflex

Boolean feature, typically of [pronouns](../../u/pos/PRON) or [determiners](../../u/pos/DET). It tells whether the word is reflexive, 
i.e. refers to the subject of its clause.

### <a name="Yes">`Yes`</a>: it is reflexive

Note that there is no `No` value. If the word is not reflexive, the `Reflex` feature will just not be mentioned in the `FEAT` column: 
an empty value has the `No` meaning.


* reflexive personal pronouns: _sá / sé / só, sí_

In all Slavic languages, including Pomak, the middle voice of verbs is formed by means of a verb form preceded or followed by a 
 reflexive pronoun, whose Pomak variants are *sa, se, só, sí* (in East Slavic, like in North Germanic and Baltic languages, the reflexive pronoun is suffixed to the verb). This pronoun is the same for all persons and numbers and is governed by strict syntactic rules as to its position in the clause.

#### Examples

- *razbúdom* "(to) wake up someone, (to) awaken someon", *razbúdom so* "(to) wake up myself, (to) awaken myself" 
- *písavom* "(to) write", *písavom so* "(to) write myself" 
- *vráštom* "(to) return someone or something", *vráštom so* "(to) return (myself)" 
- *nagádom* "(to) make, (to) prepare", *nagádom so* "(to) make myself, (to) prepare myself" 

A small number of verbs are found only in the middle voice, e.g., *čúdem so* "(to) think", *brúčkom so* "(to) be tyrannized, tortured", 
*šekóvom so*  etc.

Like most other Slavic languages, in addition to *sa, se, só*, Pomak has also the reflexive pronoun *sí*, which often precedes a wide variety of verb forms 
with different semantic effects such as:

To denote possession:
- *zabarávih sí šápkoto faf tomofílete* "I forgot my cap in the car" 
- *víjnah sí nagóso* "I turned my foot"  
- *razbíh sí kinitóto* "I broke my mobile phone" 

To denote an involvement of the subject other than that of the agent/instigator/cause, e.g., the patient or the beneficent: 
- *kúpih sí nóvo sétro* "I bought (myself) a new coat" 
- *várem sí kahvǿ* "I prepare (myself) coffee"  
- *mýjem sí rakýse* "I wash my hands"  (in French: "je me lave mes mains")

To denote transition/return to a fixed point or previous condition/situation (mainly with verbs of motion such as
 *hódem*, *dahódem*, *vráštom*, *zbírom*, *pribírom* etc.)

- *vórnah sí so ad rábato, najédah so i izpǿnah so da póčinnom* "I returned (home)from my work, ate (food) and lied down to rest" 
- *synón mu rábati faf Alamánje i še sí dójde za bajrǽm* "my son works in Germany and will come (home) for Bayram"   
- *paležá málko faf hastanǿto, alá sí so aprávi* "he was hospitalized for a while, but he fully recovered".
