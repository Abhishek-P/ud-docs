## Definite

Definiteness is typically a feature of nouns, adjectives and articles. Its value distinguishes whether we are talking 
about something known and concrete, or something general or unknown. It can be marked on definite and indefinite 
[articles](../../u/pos/DET), or directly on [nouns](../../u/pos/NOUN), [adjectives](../../u/pos/ADJ) etc. 

The Pomak definite article gives only enclitic forms; as an affix of the word on which 
it depends syntactically, it forms a single morphological unit with it. Definiteness is realised with three different forms  
(-s/-t/-n) depending on the [Deixis]() denoted(see <!--deixis pomak -- supply-->).  <!--definiteness and deixis are iseparable?-->
 
In an NP, the enclitic attaches to either the noun or the first adjective (if adjectives exist). 
---please  provide two or three examples and a detailed description of the examples-->
e.g. *kámatnyj<b>en</b> červén trendráfel je zøl da véne* "the nice red roses are wilting".

The Pomak adjective _adín / anná / annó_ "a" is used as the indefinite article and is assigned the tag [DET](). 
However, lack of an article is also understood as indefiniteness.
