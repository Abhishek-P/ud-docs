## Person

Person is typically a feature of personal and possessive [pronouns](../../u/pos/PRON), and of [verbs](../../u/pos/VERB). 
On verbs it is in fact an agreement feature that marks the person of the verb subject. Person marked on verbs
 makes it unnecessary to always add a personal pronoun as a subject, which is why subjects are sometimes dropped (in pro-drop languages).
Like other Slavic languages, Pomak is a pro-drop language.
