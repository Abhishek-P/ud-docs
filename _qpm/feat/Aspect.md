## Aspect

Aspect is a feature of verbs mainly that specifies duration of the action in time, whether the action has been completed etc.

In Pomak, as in other slavic languages, aspect is an inherent lexical feature of verbs that classifies them in two large categories: imperfective verbs

 (`imperfect aspect`) and perfective verbs (`perfect aspect`).


### <a name="Imp">`Imp`</a>: imperfect aspect

Imperfective verbs denote an action/event with no internal telic point.

#### Examples

* _kázavom_ "[to] say [always] / [to] tell [always]/ [to] narrate [always]" 
* _predávom_ "[to] sell" 
* _písavom_ "[to] write"

### <a name="Perf">`Perf`</a>: perfect aspect

Perfective verbs denote an action/event with an internal telic point.

#### Examples

* _kážom_ "[to] say [once]/ [to] tell [once][to] narrate [once]" 
* _prédadom_ "[to] sell [once]"  
* _píšom_ "[to] write [once]" 



In Pomak, iteration of an event in the past may be described from both an atelic and a telic point of view, as follows:  

### <a name="Prog">`Prog`</a>: progressive aspect

Atelic point of view: the description focuses on the (durative nature of the) iteration.

#### Examples

* _kázavah_ "[I] was saying / narrating" 
* _predávah_ :[I} was selling" 
* _písavah_ "[I] was writing" 

### <a name="Iter">`Iter`</a>: iterative aspect

Telic point of view: the description focuses on the telic events in the iteration.

#### Examples

* _kážašo_ "[he] was saying [once]"
    * _stáryjet dǽdo kážašo dečjómte annó meselǿ i to ištǽho i drúgo i drúgo_ "old grandfather was telling the children a story and they were asking for an other and an other" 
* _predadǽšo_ "[he] was selling [once]" 
    * _agá predadǽšo tütǘnete, naj napréš ídešo da sí platí kakváta bórče imǽšo_ "whenever he would sell his tobacco, he would first go and pay off all the depts he had [lit: when he was selling the tobacco, first he was going to pay off whatever dept he had]" 
* _píšašo_ "[he] was writing [once]"
