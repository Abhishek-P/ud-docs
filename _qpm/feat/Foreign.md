## Foreign

Boolean feature. Is this a foreign word? Not a loan word but a genuinely foreign word appearing inside native text, 
e.g. inside direct speech, titles of books etc.

This feature may occur with any POS tag. If the original part of speech is not known, the feature will accompany the [qpm-pos/X](../pos/X.html) tag.
