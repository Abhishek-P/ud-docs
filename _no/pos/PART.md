#####Definition
Particles are function words that must be associated with another word or phrase to impart meaning and that do not satisfy definitions of other universal parts of speech.

For Norwegian, `PART` is used for the infinitival marker *å* "to" and the negator *ikke/ikkje*, "not".

#####Examples
* _Han liker <b>ikke</b> <b>å</b> spise is_ "He does not like to eat icecream"
