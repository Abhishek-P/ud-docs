#####Definition
An auxiliary verb is a verb that accompanies the lexical verb of a verb phrase and expresses grammatical distinctions not carried by the lexical verb, such as person, number, tense, mood, aspect, and voice.

Auxiliaries in Norwegian include the temporal, passive and modal auxiliaries (see below). Note that some modals can occur without a main verb (*skal hjem* lit. *shall home* "will go home") and will then be annotated as `VERB`. The verb *være/vere*, "be" is considered as an auxiliary verb when used in periphrastic tense constructions or as a copula, but is annotated as a `VERB` in other context, e.g. when used in existential constructions.

#####Examples
* temporal: *ha* "have" (_<b>har</b> spist_ "has eaten"), *være/vere* "be" (_<b>er</b> kommet_ "has come")
* passive: *bli* "become" (_<b>blir</b> spist_ "is eaten")
* modal: *kunne* "can", *skulle* "should", *ville* "will", *måtte* "must", *burde* "should" (_<b>kan/skal/vil/må/bør</b> spise_ "can/should/will/must/should eat")
* copula: *være/vere*, "be" (_<b>er</b> god_ "is good")
