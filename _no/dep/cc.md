For more on coordination, see the [conj]() relation. A cc is the relation for the coordinating conjunction delimiting a conjunct from another. The conjuct is a dependent on the nearest conjunct following it.

~~~ sdparse
Kamskjell , piggvar og lammefilet sto på menyen \n Scallops , turbot and lamb were on the menu
cc(lammefilet,og)
~~~

A coordinating conjunction may also appear at the beginning of a sentence. This is also called a cc, and it depends on the root predicate of the sentence.
