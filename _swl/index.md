## Tokenization and Word Segmentation

* There is no punctuation.
* Multiword tokens are not used.

## Morphology

### Tags

* Swedish Sign Language uses 12 of the universal tags.
* The following tags are not used:
  * SYM and PUNCT are not used because this is not a written-language corpus.
  * PART is not used because we do not see signs that are special enough to warrant this.
  * PROPN is not used because there is no syntactic/morphological distinction with other nouns, and the corresponding semantic information is present in the glosses (proper nouns contain the `@en` substring).
  * SCONJ is not used because subordination is often only marked with non-manual markers that are not present in the transcription, or in a few cases with adverbs.
* The auxiliary tag (AUX) is used for the following cases, with remaining verb-like signs being tagged as VERB:
  * The copula *VARA* (be) and the copula-like verbs *HETA* (be named) and *SE-UT* (look like).
  * The signs *PERF* and *PERF-NEG* that mark perfect tense.
  * Modal verbs such as *SKA*, *VILL*, *KAN* that are used with a main verb.
* The tag DET is used for:
  * The sign *EN* (one) when modifying a noun as an article.
  * Pointing signs used with a noun.
* The tag PRON is used for:
  * Pronoun signs such as *PRO1*, *NÃ…GON* (somebody), etc.
  * Pointing signs when used as heads of noun phrases.
