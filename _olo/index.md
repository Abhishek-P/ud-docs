## Tokenization and Word Segmentation

* The main tokenisation is standard white-space delimited approach with
  punctuations separated.
* The punctuation is used as part of the token for ordinals written with digits:
  "123." as well some abbreviations.
* The initial tokenisation for the currently only treebank was made based on
  [morphological analyser from giellatekno](https://giellatekno.uit.no) and
  [tooling from apertium](https://wiki.apertium.org).
* for tokens with spaces, we split the morphological analyser's analyses
  and use [fixed]() where applicable, e.g. "sen ližäkse" (additionally) =
  fixed(ližäkse, sen)
