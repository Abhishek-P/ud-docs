Case is an inflectional feature of nouns and other parts of speech (adjectives, verbs, articles) that mark agreement with nouns.

In Irish four cases are used: common (which covers nominative and accusative case), vocative, genitive and dative. These cases are labelled respectively as `Nom` (common), `Voc`, `Gen`, and `Dat`.

### <a name="Nom">`Nom`</a>: common case

The common case in Irish can apply to both the nominative case and acusative case (as they are the same form).
This word form is used for subjects and objects of a clause, and predicates of a copula.

#### Examples

##### Subjects:
* _Tosóidh an <b>cheolchoirm</b> ar 8pm_ "The <b>concert</b> will start at 8pm"
* _Bhris an <b>bord</b> ina dhá leath_ "The <b>board</b> broke into two halves"

##### Objects:
* _Cuireann Paul an <b>píosa</b> seo chugainn_ "Paul offers this <b>piece</b> to us"
* _D'ith sí an <b>dinnéar</b>_ "She ate the <b>dinner</b>"

##### Predicates:
* _Is <b>láithreán</b> uafásach é seo_ "This is an awful <b>site</b>"
* _Is <b>múinteoir</b> é_ "He is a <b>teacher</b>"

### <a name="Voc">`Voc`</a>: vocative case

The vocative case is used to mark a noun as being the addresse. It is preceded by the particle `a` (see [PartType]()). The vocative case triggers lenition.

#### Examples

* _'Slán leat, <b>a</b> D<b>h</b>oráid!_ "Goodbye, Dorád!"
* _<b>A</b> d<b>h</b>aoine uaisle_ "ladies and gentlemen"

### <a name="Gen">`Gen`</a>: genitive case

The genitive case indicates possesion or ownership. Its use is similar to the use of <b>'s</b> in English. Other use cases include describing the composition of an object, compound nouns, objects of a compound preposition, and objects of a verbal noun (see [VerbForm]()).

#### Examples

* _dearadh an <b>stáitse</b>_ "outlook of the state"
* _mac an <b>fhir</b>_ "the man's son (lit. son of the man)"
* _an Aontas <b>Eorpaigh</b>_ "the European Union"

### <a name="Dat">`Dat`</a>: dative case

The dative case is used with most simple prepositions in Irish. In standard Irish, the dative form is identical to the common case.

#### Examples

* _in <b>Eireann</b>_ "in Ireland"
* _sa <b>leabhair</b>_ "in the book"
