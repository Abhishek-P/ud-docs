Irish makes use of a broad range of particles. Many of these particles have the same form but perform different functions.

NOTE: Although 'níos' is tagged as a substantive noun in the standard rule-based POS tagger and in IDT, we mark it as a particle in order to ensure consistency with the superlative form in the same manner.
