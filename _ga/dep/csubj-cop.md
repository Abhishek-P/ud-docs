A *clausal copular subject* (`csubj:cop`) is a UD Irish subtype, used to label a clause that acts as the
subject of another (copular) clause. As in all copular clauses, the
predicate acts as the head of the clause and hence it is also the
governor of the copular subject. The copular construction may consist of a copula followed by a verb particle or an adjective or it may be emphatic in terms of meaning (in which case the noun is raised for emphasis), as outlined in the examples below.
