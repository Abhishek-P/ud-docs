The `dislocated` label is used for fronted or postposed elements that do not fulfill the usual core grammatical relations of a sentence. These elements often appear to be in the periphery of the sentence, and may be separated off with a comma intonation. Few examples of this have been observed in the Irish treebank thus far.

### Examples

_(5 <b>marc</b>) (iv) Breac síos dhá phointe eolais i dtaobh an fhiontair Aisling na nÓg._ `(5 <b>marks</b>) (iv) Write down two points of information in relation to the adventure of Aisling na nÓg.
