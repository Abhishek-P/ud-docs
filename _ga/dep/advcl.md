An adverbial clause modifier is a clause which acts as an adverb and modifies a verb or other predicate (adjective, etc.), as a modifier not as a core complement. This includes temporal, consequence, conditional and purpose clauses. The dependent must be clausal (or else it is an [advmod]()) and the head is the main predicate of the clause. 

The adverbial clause has a subject and a verb. The head of the adverbial clause is dependent on the head of the clause which it is modifying, usually attached to a verb. It is an adjunct so can be removed from the sentence and sentence does not become agrammatical. 

### Examples

_<b>Temporal</b>_

_Nuair a <b>bhí</b> siad ag teacht ar ais, chonaic siad é_ 'When they <b>were</b> coming back, they saw it'

NOTE: The word 'agus', usually meaning 'and', can also introduce a subordinate clause which can in turn function as a temporal adverb.
