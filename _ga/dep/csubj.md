A clausal subject is a clausal syntactic subject of a clause, i.e. the subject is itself a clause. In the following example, *dia duit* is the subject.

_Tá <b>dia dhuit</b> iomlán ceart_  '<b>hello</b> is completely correct'
~~~ sdparse
ta dia dhuit iomlán ceart. \n is hello completely correct.
csubj(ta, dia)
~~~
We use [csubj:cop]() for clausal subjects in copular constructions when the clause contains its own subject.
We use [csubj:cleft]() for subjects of cleft constructions.
