Adpositions is a term that covers both prepositions and postpositions. Irish only has prepositions.

#### Regular prepositions

There are simple and compound prepositions in Irish.

* Simple: _ag_ "at", _le_; "with"; _from_ "ó"
* Compound: _os cionn_ "above"; _i gcoinne_ "against"

Note that the compound prepositions are split in the UD treebank (they are joined by \_ in the IDT, i.e. _os\_cionn_). 
Both elements of the compound are assigned the ADP tag, and the fine-grained tag _Cmpd_ indicates that it is part of a compound.
Usually, nouns following compound prepositions are in the genitive case. However, there are some exceptions (e.g. _maidir le_). The fine-grained POS tag for these exception compound prepositions is _CmpdNoGen_.

#### Inflected prepositions
16 of the most common simple prepositions can be inflected to mark pronominal objects. These are referred to as pronominal prepositions or prepositional pronouns.

##### Examples
 * _agam_ "at me"
 * _leis_ "with him"
 * _uainn_ "from us"

These inflections have not yet been split in the Irish UD treebank.

#### Progressive aspectual phrases

The preposition "ag" is also used in conjunction with verbal nouns to form progressive aspectual phrases.

##### Examples
* _ag rith_ "running"
* _tá sí ag ithe_ "she is eating"
