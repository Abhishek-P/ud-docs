#### Description

Pronouns are words that substitute for nouns or noun phrases, whose meaning is recoverable from the linguistic or extralinguistic context.

In Irish, third person pronouns (both singular and plural) have two forms, roughly corresponding to nominative (e.g. _sé_) and accusative (e.g. _é_) cases.
Irish pronouns also have emphatic forms  (e.g. _seisean_ and _eisean_) . 
Pronouns are often incorporated through inflection in synthetic verb forms and prepositions.

Pronominal augments or subpredicates appear in copula constructions when the subject is 3rd person singular or plural. The pronoun precedes the subject.

Irish demonstratives are either post-determiners (see [DET]()), when modifying a noun, or simply demonstrative pronouns (_siúd, seo, sin_), tagged as PRON.

#### Examples


##### personal pronouns

*  _mé_ "I"
* _tú_ "you"
* _sé_ "he"
* _sí_ "she"
* _muid_ "we"
* _sibh_ "you" (pl)
* _siad_ "they" 


* _é_ "him"
* _í_ "her"
* _sinn_ "us"
* _iad_ "them"

##### emphatic personal pronouns

* _mise_ "me"
* _tusa_ "you"
* _seisean_ "he"
* _eisean_ "him"
* _sise_ "she"
* _ise_ "her"
* _muidne_ "we"
* _sinne_ "us"
* _sibhse"_ "you" (pl)

##### Pronominal augments or subpredicates

* _ná déan <b>seo</b> agus ná déan <b>súid</b>_ "don't do this and don't do that" 


#### Notes

Note that both the indirect and direct relative pronoun are represented by _a_. However, these are currently POS-tagged as [PART]()

##### direct relative pronoun
* _An radharc <b>a</b> bhí le feiceáil_ "The sight that could be seen"


##### indirect relative pronoun

* _na cumhachtaí <b>a</b> dtugtar dó_ "The powers which are given to him"


Also note that pronouns can be incorporated in a word form through inflection. Currently these forms are not split and so take the POS tag of the lemma. 

##### synthetic verbs with incorporated pronouns
These are tagged as VERB

* _ceap<b>aim</b>_ "I think"   
* _cheap<b>fainn</b>_ "I would think"
* _cheap<b>fá</b>_ "you would think"

##### inflected prepositions with incorporated pronouns
These are tagged as ADP

* _ag<b>am</b>_ "at me"
* _ag<b>at</b>_ "at you"
