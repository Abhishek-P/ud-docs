#### Description

Adverbs typically modify verbs to indicate time, place, location or manner. In Irish, adverbs of manner, most of which tend to correspond to the English -ly adverbs (effectively, carefully), are constructed through using the particle _go_ in conjunction with an adjective. 

#### Examples

* _amach_ "out"
* _freisin_ "also"
* _go cúramach_  "carefully"
* _go hiondúil_ "usually"
