#### Description

Nouns are a part of speech typically denoting a person, place, thing, animal or idea.

The `NOUN`tag is intended for common nouns and verbal nouns. See [PROPN]() for proper nouns and [PRON]() for pronouns.

##### Common nouns

Irish nouns are either masculine or feminine, and inflect for case and number. In Old Irish, nouns inflected for nominative, accusative and dative cases. All of these are now represented in Modern Irish by what's referred to as the `common' case. An exception to this is pronoun forms, where the subject and object forms differ: _sé_ "he"/ _é_ "him".

The genitive case and vocative case are marked by inflection. 

Each noun falls into one of five declensions.


##### Verbal nouns

v2 UD documentation for [NOUN]() states that "some verb forms such as gerunds and infinitives may share properties and usage of nouns and verbs. Depending on language and context, they may be classified as either VERB or NOUN".

Verbal nouns are marked as `NOUN` in the Irish UD scheme. 
Verbal noun forms are used widely in Irish for the infinitive form, using the infinitive particle `a', (_a dhéanamh_ "to do") and progressive aspectual phrases (_ag déanamh_ "doing/ making").



#### Examples

##### Common nouns

* _fear_ "man"
