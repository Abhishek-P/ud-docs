#### Description

A proper noun is a noun that is the name of a specific individual, place, object or organisation. In Irish, proper nouns always have initial capitalisation. 

Personal names are treated as a sequence of proper nouns. Note that some Irish names have name particles, such as _Mac_, _Ó_, _Ní_, etc., that form part of this sequence (e.g. _Anne-Marie Nic Dhonncha_). These particles are tagged as [PART]().

Similarly, placenames can occur as a string of proper nouns (e.g. _Baile Átha Cliath_ "Dublin"), as can organisations (e.g. _an iris <b>Irish Computer</b>_ "the Irish Computer magazine"). Sometimes these strings can have an internal structure containing other parts of speech such as determiners, for example (_Parlaimint na hEorpa_ "the European Parliament").
In the case of counties (Co. Chiarraí), _Co._ is tagged as X (abbreviation), and the county as PROPN.

When initial mutation occurs with proper nouns in Irish, the inflection is lowercase, while the main form retains the initial capitalisation (e.g. _i mBaile Átha Cliath_ "in Dublin"). Similarly, some titles can have lower-case prefixes (e.g. _an t-iar-Ghobharnóir_ "the former Governor").

Days of the week and months of the year ar marked as proper nouns.

Some abreviations are also marked as proper nouns.
