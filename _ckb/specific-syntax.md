## 'Clitics' and Where to Split

Pronominal clitics in Sorani can mark the direct or indirect object or the subject of a clause, depending on a number of factors including position, tense and transitivity. These clitics are ambiguous with possessor agreement of nominals. The rule of thumb followed in UD Sorani is that clitics on anything other than a verb are treated analytically (i.e. the clitics are distinct tokens), whereas on verbs they are treated synthetically, as morphology.

### Possession
We do not split off possessive inflection.
