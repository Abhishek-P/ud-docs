This subtype of the [co-ordination](u-dep/conj) relation (by itself not a *dependency* relation) is used for explicative conjuncts, that is, phrases that more in-depth explain, reformulate or expand upon another phrase in the preceding clause (or the whole clause itself). 

Even if, traditionally, explicative conjuncts are sometimes described as "appositions", they represent a more general construction than UD's [appos](la-dep/appos), which is limited to (almost) immediately adjoined noun phrases; while both are in a sense co-referential, explicative conjuncts differ from appositions mainly under the aspect that explicative conjuncts show to be at the same foregrounding level than the phrases they are related to (whereas `appos` rather implies background information). This makes them a subclass of co-ordination.

Any phrase can be the explicative conjunct of any other phrase, but it will show an alignment in its syntactic encoding towards the latter, e.g. a clausal explicative conjunct of a noun phrase will be usually introduced by a complementiser. The explicative conjunct, as any regular conjunct (or apposition), will recover the case of the expanded phrase, as far as this is applicable. The explicative conjunct may be elliptical.

Often, but not always, an explicative conjunct is introduced by a conjunctional element, which is coherently labeled as [`CCONJ`](la-pos/CCONJ) and bears the feature [`ConjType=Expl`](la-feat/ConjType), in parallel to this subrelation. In Late and Medieval Latin, the grammaticalised verbal phrases *scilicet* 'you may know' and *id est* 'that is' (sometimes [univerbated](la-feat/Compound)) are amongst the most common ones. The relation might also be pointed to by dedicated punctuation marks.

Sometimes, explicative conjuncts look similar to [dislocated](u-dep/dislocated) elements. However, they differ in that 

1. dislocations are lexically asymmetric: most of the times the dislocated element is a heavy and lexically full unit, while the dislocating element tends to be a functional word like a [pronoun](la-pos/PRON) or a [determiner](la-pos/DET); 
1. logically, explicative conjuncts always come after the expanded element, while dislocated elements do not have this constraint: they are pushed at the margins of the sentence, be it before or after the dislocating element.

'But there is nothing the monarch could covet, for his jurisdiction is bounded only by the ocean; whereas this is not the case with other rulers, whose sovereignty extends only as far as the neighbouring kingdom, as is the case, for instance, with the kings of Castille and of Aragon.
