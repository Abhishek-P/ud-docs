This subtype of [`cop`](la-dep/cop) is used alongside of [`nsubj:outer`](u-dep/nsubj-outer) to clearly differentiate the copula "supporting" a clausal non-verbal predicate from any other predication that might appear in the latter. If the [copula](la-pos/AUX) (in Latin *sum*) is expressed, this subtype is always used whenever `nsubj:outer` would also be used. Other arguments and modifiers of the matrix clause are currently not explicitly differentiated this way.

'the perfect way of understanding consists in the understanding of things which in their very nature are intelligible' (`ITTB train-s5236`, *Summa Contra Gentiles* lib. 2 cap. 91 n. 8, Thomas Aquinas)

* The original literally uses the copula *sum* and not a lexical verb like *consisto* 'to consist'. The clausal non-verbal predicate is signalled and introduced by the connector ([`SCONJ`](la-pos/SCONJ)) *ut*, and headed by a so-called [finite form](la-feat/VerbForm) of the verb *intelligo* 'to understand'.
