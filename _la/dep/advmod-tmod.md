This semantical subrelation is used to single out those [adverbial](la-dep/advmod) modifiers that express a temporal reference, usually by means of a particular subclass of words which are marked with [`AdvType=Tim`](la-feat/AdvType) and conventionally annotated as [`ADV`](la-pos/ADV)s.

The kinds of temporal relations expressed (duration, definiteness, and so on) are often readable from the morphological history of the adverbial element (e.g. *hodie* 'today' is a contraction of the ablative phrase *hoc die* 'on this day'), but do not appear to be fully standardised (i.e. there is a variety of synchronically non-predictable forms, like *semper* 'always').

The `tmod` subrelation is also used for [oblique](la-dep/obl-tmod) arguments, which usually consist of nominal phrases: since, in Latin, this appears to be a purely formal distinction with regard to *adverbial* temporal (but also [locative](la-dep/advmod-lmod)) expressions (often derived from nominal forms), the use of `tmod` aims to capture the fundamental unitarity of such constructions.

'His judgements abhor all severity, for he punishes **ever** on this side the mean, while in rewarding he aims ever beyond the mean.' (*Letters*, UDante)
