This subtype of [`parataxis`](u-dep/parataxis) is used symmetrically to [`parataxis:reporting`](la-dep/parataxis-reporting) to mark the reference to someone or something initiating a direct discourse, but presented only as a juxtaposed, backgrounded phrase.

ccomp(dixeris, instauratam)

Here the name of the speaker *Savarisius* is not syntactically integrated into the sentence (as the subsequent indirect speech is), but is rather a useful indication to the reader to understand who is beginning a speech.
