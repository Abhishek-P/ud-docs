(This page is still referring to the `pred` subtype, which was subsumed under the simple `xcomp` relation. It remains valid for this particular case and will be expanded.)

The `pred` subrelation aims at unitarily representing the phenomenon of **secondary predications** (also "conjoined participles", it. *participio congiunto*, "double nominative/accusative", "subject/object complements", "adverbial appositions", "depictives", and so on) in its different realisations. 

Contrary to adverbial secondary predications (see [`advcl:pred`](la-dep/advcl-pred)), "core" or "complemental" secondary predications are foregrounded (and therefore not subordinated) and can be seen as forming an extension of the main predicate, in a similar way to [closed](la-dep/xcomp) (e.g. of modal verbs, *possum <u>facere</u>* 'I can do') or [open](la-dep/ccomp) (e.g. verbs of saying, *dico <u>te hoc facere</u>* 'I say that you do that') clausal complements. They are nearly always referring to the object of the main sentence or, equivalently, to the subject in passive constructions (e.g. with *videor* 'I seem', lit. 'I am seen'). Core secondary predications are not so much predicating something about their referent as describing a result, state or judgment implied by the predicate in which the referents are involved. Like for their adverbial versions,  these secondary predications cannot be selected for [passivisation](la-feat/Voice) and are distinct from [secondary objects](la-dep/iobj).

This subrelation overlaps for the most part with the complements of so-called "copular verbs". Being nominal in form (including [participles](la-feat/VerbForm) and the likes), they are formally set apart from other clausal complements, like those of modal verbs, which are usually expressed by [finite or infinitival](la-feat/VerbForm) clauses. Copular and modal verbs are always treated as [verbs](la-pos/VERB) which can govern complements and not as [auxiliaries](la-pos/AUX), since they still are fully lexical elements.

It is true that the identification of a secondary predication as [adverbial](la-dep/advcl-pred) rather than core, being both formally identical (bare nominal predications), is not always straightforward, and much depends on the semantics of the main predicate.

In the following examples, the passages in the translations corresponding to core secondary predications are boldfaced. The corresponding main predicate is underlined.
