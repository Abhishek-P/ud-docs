This semantical subrelation is used to single out those [oblique](la-dep/obl) arguments that express a temporal reference, usually by means of nominal elements with meanings related to temporal entities, or implying some duration or time point. 

Latin temporal oblique arguments make use of various strategies, mainly involving either the ablative or the accusative [case](la-feat/Case) and sometimes [adpositions](la-pos/ADP) (overwhelmingly [prepositions](la-feat/AdpType)), depending on duration, definiteness, and other factors. These strategies largely correspond to (and in many cases originate from) those used for [locative arguments](la-dep/obl-lmod) and are based on a rough conceptual division between ablative-punctual and accusative-durative. For this reason, it is not always easy to distinguish between a temporal or a locative value, and a slight preference is given to the latter.  

The `tmod` subrelation is also used for [adverbial](la-dep/advmod-tmod) modifiers: since, in Latin, this appears to be a purely formal distinction with regard to oblique temporal (but also [locative](la-dep/obl-lmod)) arguments, the use of `tmod` aims to capture the fundamental unitarity of such constructions.
