`PronType` is a feature of [pronouns](PRON). It helps differenciating between wh-questions (`PronType=Int`) and wh-indefinite (`PronType=Ind`) pronouns.

### <a name="Int">`Int`</a>: Interrogative

Interrogative pronouns used for asking a question. The question can be direct or embedded.

#### Examples

* 你想吃<b>什麼</b>？ / _Nǐ xiǎng chī <b>shénme</b>?_ “What do you want to eat?”
* 你想吃<b>什麼</b>我都不知道。/ _Nǐ xiǎng chī <b>shénme</b> wǒ dōu bù zhīdào。_ “I don't know what you want to eat.”

### <a name="Ind">`Ind`</a>: Indefinite

In concordance with the polarity 嗎 particle, with the NEG polarity markers 不/没 or some other particular constructions, these wh-word become indefinite pronouns.

#### Examples

* 你想吃<b>什麼</b>嗎？ / _Nǐ xiǎng chī <b>shénme</b> ma?_ “Do you want to eat anything?”
