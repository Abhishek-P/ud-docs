Person[psor]
is possessor's person, marked on Hungarian nouns. These noun
forms would be translated to English as possessive pronoun + noun.

This layered feature is conveniently used for possessive inflections
of nouns, although nouns normally do not have a `Person` feature,
meaning that no other layers are needed. Nevertheless, the possessive
morphology typically also includes `Number`, which must be multi-layered
on nouns, and we thus have `Person[psor]` together with `Number[psor]`.

### <a name="1">`1`</a>: first person possessor

#### Examples

* [apu] _herẽka_ “blood”
* [apu] _<b>nỹerẽka</b>_ “my blood”
* [apu] _<b>ãerẽka</b>_ “our blood”

### <a name="2">`2`</a>: second person possessor

#### Examples

* [apu] _herẽka_ “blood”
* [apu] _<b>pỹerẽka</b>_ “your.Sing blood”
* [apu] _<b>hỹerẽka</b>_ “your.Plur blood”

### <a name="3">`3`</a>: third person possessor

#### Examples

* [apu] _herẽka_ “blood”
* [apu] _<b>ỹerẽka</b>_ “his/its blood”
* [apu] _<b>ũerẽka</b>_ “her/its blood”
* [apu] _<b>ỹerẽkana</b>_ “their.Masc blood”
* [apu] _<b>ũerẽkana</b>_ “their.Fem blood”
