Form has been introduced as a language specific feature for Irish. It covers both the morphology of direct/indirect relative markers, and initial mutation.

These forms of verbs and adjectives modify a following nominal.
An auxiliary may be attached to the clause to the left, to which it provides the adnominal ending.

#### Examples

* 통화 기능을 훨씬 <b>뛰어넘는</b> 도구가 / _tonghwa gineungeul hweolssin <b>ddwieoneomneun</b> doguga_ “a tool that goes far beyond calling”


### <a name="Aux">`Aux`</a>: auxiliary form

A verb with an auxiliary ending such as _-ji_ or _-go_ is usually attached to the following verb as its auxiliary.

#### Examples

### <a name="Compl">`Compl`</a>: complement form

A verb with complement ending such as _-hae_ or _-seo_ is usually attached to a following verb as an adverbial clause.

#### Examples
