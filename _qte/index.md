# UD for Telugu English <span class="flagspan"><img class="flag" src="../../flags/svg/IN.svg" /></span>

In genral, the Telugu-English code-switched treebank follows the guidelines of invidiual Telugu and English treebanks. 

## Introduction
The treebank consists of edited data from the Telugu UD treebank (Rama and Vajilla, 2021), sentences from a grammar book, and the MASSIVE dataset, spoken conversational utterances in Telugu (FitzGerald et al., 2022; Bastianelli et al., 2020). The sentences were randomly selected from each corpus. The sentences were romanized and each sentence was altered to contain at least one code-switch. The sentences were then annotated following the Universal Dependencies annotation scheme.


## Language IDs
- All sentences in the treebank include at least one code-switch from Telugu to English. The language labels of the tokens are represented in the MISC column. 
- The values in the MISC column are: `te` for Telugu, `en` for English, and `univ` for punctuation and symbols.

## Tokenization and Word Segmentation
- In general, words are delimeted by whitespace characters or punctuation. 
- Puncuation are tokenized as separate tokens, with the exception of abbreviations and hyphenated compounds. 
- There are no multiword tokens. 


## Morphology

### Tags
- Telugu uses 14 of the 17 universal POS tags. There are no auxiliary verbs, symbols, and unknown words. 
- English uses all 17 universal POS tags. 
- The Telugu `PRON` vs `DET` distinction is based on word lists. 


### Features

- The treebank uses the features of inidividual [Telugu](https://github.com/UniversalDependencies/docs/blob/pages-source/_te/index.md) and [English](https://github.com/UniversalDependencies/docs/blob/pages-source/_en/index.md) treebanks.
- The features used are ID, FORM, UPOSTAG, XPOSTAG, HEAD, DEPREL, MISC. 
- The new features in this treebank are `Lang`, as described in the Language IDs section above.


## Syntax

- The treebank uses the standard syntax of inidividual [Telugu](https://github.com/UniversalDependencies/docs/blob/pages-source/_te/index.md) and [English](https://github.com/UniversalDependencies/docs/blob/pages-source/_en/index.md) treebanks.

However, publicly available SLU resources are limited. In this paper, we release SLURP, a new SLU package containing the following: (1) A new challenging dataset in English spanning 18 domains, which is substantially bigger and linguistically more diverse than existing datasets; (2) Competitive baselines based on state-of-the-art NLU and ASR systems; (3) A new transparent metric for entity labelling which enables a detailed error analysis for identifying potential areas of improvement. SLURP is available at https://github.com/pswietojanski/slurp."
